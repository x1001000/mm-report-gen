### When the A-Team Breaks Up



[![When the A-Team Breaks Up](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/d3146f63-313757.png)](https://pse.is/7ll2rl)





#### The U.S. loses its last AAA credit rating: 

Moody’s downgraded the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1 due to rising debt levels, high interest expenses, and long-term fiscal risks. This follows earlier downgrades by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023, marking the complete loss of AAA status across all major rating agencies. The downgrade triggered a spike in the 30-year Treasury yield to 5% and a rise in credit default swap (CDS) spreads, signaling increased market concern.

#### U.S.-China trade truce fuels short-term market optimism: 

A temporary 90-day tariff reduction deal between the U.S. and China led to a strong rally in global equity markets and a sell-off in safe-haven assets. However, the agreement mirrors past episodes that ultimately unraveled, and unresolved issues around technology, strategic resources, and currency policy suggest that risks to a lasting resolution remain high.

#### U.S. retail sales remain resilient amid cooling inflation: 

April data showed steady retail growth, particularly in services and e-commerce, despite tariff-related weakness in goods like automobiles and apparel. Inflation indicators cooled, reinforcing expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts later in 2025. Strong employment and wage growth continue to support consumer spending and broader economic stability.

"1149","Yardeni Research | Earnings & Valuation Under Trump 2.0 So Far","yardeni-research-earnings-valuation-under-trump-2-so-far","2025-05-14","#### Executive Summary: 
Even though Q1 earnings were fabulous, most economists, industry analysts, and corporate managements have low hopes that Trump’s Tariff Turmoil won’t dunk the US economy into a recession this year. Not us: We’re counting on the economy’s resilience. Today, Dr Ed discusses why the widely expected recession, like others in recent years, will be a no-show. Hard-to-ignore reasons include record-high forward earnings, strong economic indicators, and a forward P/E that hasn’t plunged as happens when a recession is imminent. Stock investors seem to be in our camp. Moreover, Trump’s tariff overreach is bound to be tempered by the courts and mid-term election realities if nothing else. … Check out the accompanying [chart collection](https://yardeni.com/wp-content/uploads/cc_20250512.pdf).

#### Strategy I: Recession Forecasts Still in Fashion.
Once again, economists are debating the odds of a near-term recession. They’ve done so over much of the past three years. Most of them reckoned that the tightening of monetary policy, the fall in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, and the inverting yield curve all meant that a recession was all but inevitable. They were wrong. All along, we counted on the underlying resilience of the US economy to keep GDP growing apace. That worked out well for us.
 
Here we go again. This year, the naysayers are convinced that Trump’s Tariff Turmoil (TTT) will cause a recession during the second half of this year. We are still betting on the resilience of the economy. We’ve also been betting that Trump will blink and unilaterally deescalate his one-man Tariff Man trade war. So far, so good. Mounting concerns among Republicans that they could lose their majorities in both houses of Congress if TTT causes a recession undoubtedly have softened Trump’s stance.
 
In addition, we anticipated that several court cases would challenge Trump’s constitutional authority to impose tariffs. Our good friend Jim Lucier of [Capital Alpha Partners](https://www.capalphadc.com/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-813eV_PNVonNGUFGVqK7YoXw3uFAsZ8dIBvjNvV-IkQVL8Rd7c1VHLq7MYTyUhGf56-PpeYzK1UGr3GSnAnacTVxRSKg&_hsmi=2) observes: “The first showdown in court over President Donald Trump’s IEEPA tariffs is coming Tuesday, May 13, at 11 AM ET. The Court of International Trade (CIT) in New York City will hold a hearing on all pending motions in one of four pending challenges to IEEPA in that court. The case brought by the Liberty Justice Center on behalf of small business plaintiffs is V.O.S. Selections, Inc. et al. v Trump et al. None other than Trump’s former U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on April 28 that ‘there is a reasonable chance the CIT will enjoin’ Trump’s IEEPA tariffs (See video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLpUSMIN_vw&utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-813eV_PNVonNGUFGVqK7YoXw3uFAsZ8dIBvjNvV-IkQVL8Rd7c1VHLq7MYTyUhGf56-PpeYzK1UGr3GSnAnacTVxRSKg&_hsmi=2), minute 49:00).”
 
Here is what we wrote on April 7: “Trump’s Liberation Day last Wednesday triggered Annihilation Days on Thursday and Friday, with the Stock Market Vigilantes giving a costly thumbs-down to Trump’s Reign of Tariffs. Trump officials say they aim to make Main Street wealthy again even if that’s bad for Wall Street. The problem is that Main Street owns lots of equities traded on Wall Street, so the two streets prosper and suffer together. Congress can’t do much to stop Trump given his veto power, but he might get the message that hurting Main Street’s stock portfolios can cause a recession and jeopardize the GOP majority in Congress. If so, he might postpone the reciprocal tariffs, giving trade negotiations time to work. Also, the courts might block Trump’s tariffs. An early end to Trump’s tariff nightmare would result in a V-shaped stock-market bottom. We’re counting on that; the alternative is just plain ugly.”
 
The S&P 500’s 18.9% correction since February 19 troughed on April 8; the next day, Trump postponed his April 2 Liberation Day reciprocal tariffs. The S&P 500 closed up 9.5% that day, April 9. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/c6d6a734-623996.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - S&P 500](https://en.macromicro.me/series/2/sp500)*

It is now up 13.6% since the trough and only 7.9% below its record high!
 
The April 17 WSJ [reviewed](https://www.wsj.com/economy/economists-outlook-recession-gdp-pce-unemployment-00d35eb3?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-813eV_PNVonNGUFGVqK7YoXw3uFAsZ8dIBvjNvV-IkQVL8Rd7c1VHLq7MYTyUhGf56-PpeYzK1UGr3GSnAnacTVxRSKg&_hsmi=2) the latest quarter survey of economists’ forecasts. It was conducted from April 4 to April 8, just before Trump postponed his Liberation Day tariffs. Economists raised the probability of a recession in the next 12 months to 45% from 20%. They expect the unemployment rate to reach 4.7% by December and remain around there into 2026.
 
The May 3 WSJ featured a [story](https://www.wsj.com/finance/recession-risks-stocks-investors-e77c11be?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-813eV_PNVonNGUFGVqK7YoXw3uFAsZ8dIBvjNvV-IkQVL8Rd7c1VHLq7MYTyUhGf56-PpeYzK1UGr3GSnAnacTVxRSKg&_hsmi=2) titled “What Recession? Stock Investors Expect the Good Times to Continue.” It noted: “Wall Street’s best forecasters have been warning that tariffs could spark a recession. Goldman Sachs puts the chances at 45% in the next 12 months. Apollo Global Management’s top economist recently pegged it at 90%.” BCA also remains solidly in the recession camp.
 
We lowered our odds of a recession from 45% to 35% on May 4. We did so because Trump continued to moderate his stance on tariffs. In addition, the labor market has remained impressively resilient. We are also less concerned about a negative wealth effect on consumer spending now that the stock market has rebounded significantly. Additionally, we expect that capital spending related to datacenters for cloud computing and the onshoring of manufacturing will remain robust.
 
Consider the following:
 
(1) Last week’s batch of economic indicators lowered the odds of a recession, according to Polymarkets.com, to 51% on Friday from a peak of 66% on May 1.

Meanwhile, the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for the US has been only slightly negative since April 29.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Citi Economic Surprise Index & Earnings Revision Index](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/34/us-stock-relative/55674/us-citi-surprise-index-earnings-revision)*
 
(2) This week, a bunch of soft and hard economic indicators will be released, mostly for April. The soft indicators include data on small business owners’ concerns and expectations from the National Federation of Independent Business’ (NFIB) survey of its members. The main hard ones will be retail sales, industrial production, housing starts, and jobless claims.
 
The NFIB’s Small Business Optimism Index (SBOI) dropped sharply in March. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/03d6ee92-189813.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - NFIB Small Business Optimism Index](https://en.macromicro.me/series/18326/nfib-small-business-optimism-index)*
 
It might have ticked up in April in response to the 90-day postponement of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. Then again, the tariffs on China remain prohibitive and undoubtedly depressed sentiment among small business owners who import lots of merchandise from China. We will be watching the SBOI as well as the NFIB data on small business job openings and hiring plans.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/d7ab7886-286926.png)
 
(3) May’s regional business surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve district banks of New York and Philadelphia will also be released this week. They probably remained depressed in May but less so than in April, which was the height of TTT.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/393738c1-198483.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Regional PMIs](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/8/us-industry-relative/39/pmi-others)*
 
(4) Perhaps the most important report this coming week will be the one for April’s retail sales. It’s unlikely to show that consumers are retrenching in response to TTT. More likely is that it will be boosted by lots of buying in advance of tariff-related price increases. The Redbook Retail Sales Index rose 6.9% y/y through the May 2 week.

The labor market also remains resilient, as confirmed by the latest weekly report for unemployment claims.

#### Strategy II: Earnings Under Trump 2.0. 
Industry analysts must finally have received the tariff-recession memo. In recent weeks, they’ve been slashing their estimates for S&P 500 companies’ operating earnings per share (EPS) for the final three quarters of 2025.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/6b6b1fb3-149187.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - S&P 500 EPS](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4393/sp500-eps-collection/35720/sp500-eps)*

That’s despite Q1’s big earnings beat.
 
At the start of the latest earnings reporting season, the analysts collectively expected a 6.0% y/y increase in S&P 500 companies’ aggregate EPS for Q1. As of the May 8 week, after 90% of the S&P 500 companies had reported Q1 results, the blended estimated/actual growth rate was up to 11.2% y/y. With Q1 growth nearly double the analysts’ initial expectations as reporting began, this was far from a weak quarter. Obviously, it was what company managements said on the conference calls that caused analysts to take paring knives to their estimates for the rest of this year; and obviously, it was Trump’s Liberation Day shocker that festered rampant uncertainty and pessimism among managements.
 
As a result, the analysts’ 2025 and 2026 EPS estimates were revised down since the start of the year through the May 8 week by about $10 each to $265 and $300. (We are still estimating $260 and $300.)
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/54b745a0-166280.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - S&P 500 - Forward PE Ratio & EPS](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/123063/us-s-p-500-forward-pe-ratio-eps)*
 
S&P 500 forward operating earnings—which is the time-weighted average of analysts’ consensus EPS expectations for 2025 and 2026—rose to a record high of $279.13 on April 3. It has been hovering around that level since then, as of the May 8 week. It will converge toward the 2026 analysts’ consensus EPS over the rest of the year, as forward EPS by definition do. So despite the downward revisions of analysts’ quarterly and annual EPS consensus estimates, there’s is no evidence so far of a recession in S&P 500 forward earnings, which tends to fall sharply during economic downturns.
 
By the way, Joe reports that on a proforma basis, which assumes the S&P 500’s current members were also in the index a year earlier, Q1 earnings is up by 14.1%.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - S&P 500 - Forward PE Ratio & EPS](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/123063/us-s-p-500-forward-pe-ratio-eps)*

Excluding the S&P 500 Energy sector, which has been depressed by falling oil prices, S&P 500 proforma Q1 EPS was up 16.1% y/y through the May 9 week.

Bloomberg’s Lu Wang reports that 21 of Wall Street’s investment strategists predicted in April that S&P 500 EPS will be $261 this year on average, with the median forecast at $257. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/122a37b6-427042.png)

At the end of last year, they were projecting $269 on average, with the median at $271.(We then were at $285.)
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/1785a8cf-107346.png)
 
According to Bloomberg, Wall Street’s strategists predicted in April that the S&P 500 will end the year at 6,047 on average. We remain at 6000.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/0f4b6e05-652212.png)
 
#### Strategy III: Valuation Under Trump 2.0. 
As noted above, forward earnings expectations remain remarkably resilient notwithstanding widespread fears of a recession. The same can be said of valuation multiples.
 
The S&P 500’s forward P/E (i.e., the multiple using forward earnings as the “E”) fell from about 22 at the start of this year to 18 on April 8.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/3283155a-331883.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - S&P 500 - Forward PE Ratio & EPS](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/123063/us-s-p-500-forward-pe-ratio-eps)*

Now it is back a bit above 20. Leading the way down in the S&P 500’s correction was a sharp drop in the forward P/E of the Magnificent-7 stocks from 31 to 22. It is now back at 25.
 
Usually in recessions, the forward P/E of the S&P 500 falls into the single digits. It hasn’t done so this time because the stock market isn’t pricing in a recession. Neither are industry analysts, according to their latest EPS estimates.
 
During the previous bear market, the forward P/E bottomed at 15.1 on October 22, 2022. That too was a relatively high P/E and occurred because the most widely anticipated recession of all times was a no-show. History may already be repeating itself in the performance of the stock market and the economy so far this year.

### US & China Find Ground in Tariff War - Has the Rubicon Been Crossed?




[![US & China Find Ground in Tariff War](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1150/a5212deb-290291.png)](https://pse.is/7kebz4)





#### 1. U.S.–China and U.S.–UK Trade Deals Signal a Shift Toward De-escalation

The U.S. has reached preliminary trade deals with both China and the UK, signaling a major pivot from the aggressive tariff policies seen in early 2025. With China, both sides agreed to a 90-day window of tariff relief, capping duties at 30% before potential hikes resume. The U.S. also canceled two executive orders that would have drastically increased tariffs. This comes as inflationary pressure in the U.S. and deflation risks in China create a mutual incentive to stabilize trade. Meanwhile, the U.S.–UK deal includes key tariff reductions—0% on steel and aluminum and a 10% cap on 100,000 car imports. However, it excludes pharmaceuticals and film, both significant trade sectors, indicating it’s only an initial framework. These deals aim to temper economic uncertainty and reflect a broader trend of easing global protectionism amid slowing growth.

---

#### 2. Tariff Uncertainty Influences U.S. Monetary Policy and Economic Outlook

The Federal Reserve has maintained interest rates at 4.25–4.5% while signaling increased caution due to tariff-driven risks. Chairman Powell emphasized a “wait-and-see” strategy, highlighting how tariffs have added layers of economic uncertainty. While unemployment remains low and inflation is only slightly above 2%, the Fed flagged potential threats to both price stability and labor markets. Additionally, liquidity pressures are rising as the Fed reduces its balance sheet and the Treasury’s debt ceiling constraints limit bond issuance. An end to quantitative tightening and possible rate cuts in the second half of 2025 could follow, depending on how tariff talks unfold. The central bank's restraint reflects its concern that acting prematurely could destabilize markets. Overall, tariffs are now a major variable shaping the Fed’s near-term decisions, highlighting how trade policy is directly influencing monetary strategy.

---

#### 3. Taiwan Dollar Surge Driven by Trade Optimism and U.S. Currency Policy

The Taiwan dollar (TWD) has emerged as one of the top-performing currencies in Asia, appreciating over 10% in early May. This surge is attributed to multiple factors: Taiwan’s central bank eased foreign exchange intervention to avoid being labeled a currency manipulator by the U.S.; progress in U.S.–Taiwan trade negotiations boosted investor sentiment; and speculation about coordinated dollar-weakening policies (a so-called “Mar-a-Lago Accord”) also lifted Asian currencies. Strong Q1 economic data from Taiwan—5.37% GDP growth and a 20.1% export rise—reinforced the currency’s strength. However, analysts caution that the rally may be short-lived, with slowing global demand and high comparison bases posing risks in the second half of the year. The TWD’s performance showcases how geopolitical trade developments and central bank strategies can intersect to influence forex markets, especially when tied to broader U.S. policy shifts.

"1144","Yardeni Research | Is The Recession Over Already?","yardeni-research-is-the-recession-over-already","2025-05-07","#### Executive Summary: 
We believe in the resilience of the US economy. Recent years’ monetary tightening didn’t bring on a recession; this year’s tariff turmoil isn’t likely to either. We’re lowering the odds we see of a recession back to 35%, where it had been in early March. One reason is that China and the US appear ready to start negotiating a trade deal. Trump needs to get past trade issues for the Republicans to keep their majorities in Congress after the midterms. … Also: The Index of Coincident Economic Indicators has been rising to new record highs. And Friday’s jobs report boosted our confidence in the labor market’s resilience. …And: Time to raise our S&P 500 target? 
Check out the accompanying [chart collection](https://yardeni.com/wp-content/uploads/cc_20250505.pdf).

#### US Economy I: The Godot Recession Is Back. 
During 2022, 2023, and 2024, most economists and investment strategists expected that the dramatic tightening of monetary policy would cause a recession. They observed that the inverting yield curve and the falling Index of Leading Economic Indicators were confirming this outlook. We argued that the recession was the most widely anticipated recession of all times that wasn’t likely to happen. We called it the “[Godot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_Godot?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9EAFsRZHo1yF1VCZKBHUVHJ-bBqe3hc1ff9ThmVzGNmB0xLR-XD0AomLas_gW-K5xL1cd2nyYhpURJ-8jZzZSmXsy9GQ&_hsmi=2) recession.” We focused on the reasons for the underlying resilience of the economy and dismissed the widely followed leading indicators of recession as misleading.
 
The Godot recession may be back in 2025. This time, the cause of the widely anticipated downturn is Trump’s Tariff Turmoil.
 
According to Polymarket.com, a trading platform, the chance of a recession was relatively low around 20% from the time President Donald Trump was inaugurated on January 20 through March 11.

The odds then shot up dramatically, especially after April 2 (“Liberation Day”), reaching 64% on April 8. They fluctuated around 55% after Trump postponed for 90 days the reciprocal tariffs that he had announced on April 2 for all countries with one notable exception: China’s tariff remained 145%. The odds of a recession rose to 66% on May 1 following last week’s batch of weak economic indicators (i.e., consumer confidence, ADP payrolls, M-PMI, and jobless claims). The odds fell to 60% on Friday, May 2, following the release of a stronger-than-expected employment report for April.
 
While economic growth remains our base-case scenario, we did raise our subjective probability of a “tariff-induced” recession from 20% at the start of the year to 35% on March 5. We wrote, “We are still betting on the resilience of consumers and the economy. However, Trump Turmoil 2.0 is significantly testing the resilience of both. That’s why we’ve recalibrated our subjective probabilities.” On March 31, we raised the odds again to 45% and blamed Trump’s Reign of Tariffs. We wrote, “That 45% is also the probability we see that the stock market’s correction will deepen into a bear market in coming months. Yet we still expect an up year, with the S&P 500 rising above 6000 by year-end.”
 
In other words, we remained, and remain, believers in the resilience of the economy. It withstood the tightening of monetary policy over the past three years. We expect it will withstand this year’s tariff turmoil.
 
#### US Economy II: Lowering Our Odds of a Recession. 
We are now lowering our odds of a recession back down to 35% because we believe that China and the US both may be ready to suspend their tariffs on each other while they negotiate a trade deal. In other words, both sides may be starting to blink. Neither side can bear the pain of a trade war, which might be more painful for China’s economy than America’s economy. On the other hand, Americans have less tolerance for pain than the Chinese (for more on China’s “chiku” ethos, see the [Morning Briefing](https://yardeni.com/wp-content/uploads/mb_20250429.pdf?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9EAFsRZHo1yF1VCZKBHUVHJ-bBqe3hc1ff9ThmVzGNmB0xLR-XD0AomLas_gW-K5xL1cd2nyYhpURJ-8jZzZSmXsy9GQ&_hsmi=2) dated April 29, 2025).
 
We also expect that Trump will declare victory in his trade war with the rest of the world. By the end of the 90-day postponement period of his Liberation Day reciprocal tariffs, the US is likely to have signed numerous agreements with America’s major trading partners. Stragglers might come around during a second 90-day postponement period. Trump needs to put the trade issue behind him to reduce the odds of a recession, which would harm the Republicans’ chances of holding onto their slim majorities in both houses of Congress.
 
Trump also needs to get this issue resolved quickly now that numerous court cases have been filed challenging his constitutional authority to impose tariffs under his claim that they are warranted by a national crisis that he declared.
 
We anticipated all the above in our April 7 [Morning Briefing](https://yardeni.com/wp-content/uploads/mb_20250407.pdf?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9EAFsRZHo1yF1VCZKBHUVHJ-bBqe3hc1ff9ThmVzGNmB0xLR-XD0AomLas_gW-K5xL1cd2nyYhpURJ-8jZzZSmXsy9GQ&_hsmi=2) titled “Annihilation Days.” We wrote:
 
“Trump’s Liberation Day last Wednesday triggered Annihilation Days on Thursday and Friday, with the Stock Market Vigilantes giving a costly thumbs-down to Trump’s Reign of Tariffs. Trump officials say they aim to make Main Street wealthy again even if that’s bad for Wall Street. The problem is that Main Street owns lots of equities traded on Wall Street, so the two streets prosper and suffer together. Congress can’t do much to stop Trump given his veto power, but he might get the message that hurting Main Street’s stock portfolios can cause a recession and jeopardize the GOP majority in Congress. If so, he might postpone the reciprocal tariffs, giving trade negotiations time to work. Also, the courts might block Trump’s tariffs. An early end to Trump’s tariff nightmare would result in a V-shaped stock-market bottom. We’re counting on that; the alternative is just plain ugly.”
 
Sure enough: Trump postponed his reciprocal tariffs two days later, on April 9. The S&P 500 traced out a V-shape, bottoming on April 8 and climbing 14.1% since then through Friday’s close.

We aren’t dismissing the possibility of a recession. There could still be supply disruptions resulting from the still unresolved trade war with China. Regional and national business surveys show weakening economic activity and rising prices during March and April.

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/811ab30c-161843.png)

Meanwhile, the Index of Coincident Economic Indicators (CEI) has been rising to new record highs since then through March!
 
We are betting on the resilience of consumer spending, which has been boosted by the spending of retiring Baby Boomers. We had been concerned recently about the negative wealth effect on consumption because of the drop in stock prices. Now we are less concerned given the subsequent rebound in stock prices. We are also betting on business spending to remain resilient. While tariff-related uncertainties may weigh on capital spending, we expect that spending related to cloud computing and onshoring will remain strong.
 
#### US Economy III: The Most Resilient Labor Market. 
The CEI probably edged up to another record high during April. That’s because nonfarm payroll employment in private industries, which rose to a record high in April, is one of the four components of the CEI.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Nonfarm Employment Diffusion Index](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4/us-employ-relative/72744/us-nfp-diffusion-index)*

It tends to boost two of the other components, i.e., real personal income and real manufacturing and trade sales. The fourth CEI component is industrial production, which probably declined in April along with manufacturing aggregate weekly hours, as shown in April’s employment report.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Industrial Production & Capacity Utilization](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/3261/sector-industrial/45/production)*
 
By the way, the S&P 500 is also one of the 10 components of the LEI. We lowered our recession/stagflation odds today partly because the stock market is indicating that the outlook for the economy is improving. Friday’s jobs report also increased our confidence in the resilience of the labor market. Let’s review it:
 
**(1) Earned Income Proxy.** 
Aggregate weekly hours in private industries rose 0.1% m/m to a new record high of 4.7 billion during April.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/9f74fae1-129271.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Average Weekly Working Hours](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4/us-employ-relative/20499/us-average-work-time-weekly)*

Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% m/m last month. So our Earned Income Proxy for wages and salaries in private industries rose 0.3% to a new record high in April. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/2a6a3ce8-1056575.png)

That augurs well for April’s consumer spending. Indeed, April’s auto sales remained robust at 17.3 million units (saar).

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Monthly Vehicle Sales](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/120/us-car-sales)*

**(2) Payroll employment. **
Payroll employment rose 177,000 during April. We expected 150,000-175,000. So we weren’t surprised, though the consensus expectation was lower at 135,000. The previous two months were revised down by 58,000. Nevertheless, the average for the past three months was a solid increase of 155,000.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Nonfarm Payrolls vs. Unemployment Rate](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4/us-employ-relative/6/employment-condition)*

Much of the strength in payrolls comes from services industries that cater to retiring Baby Boomers, particularly health care and social assistance, leisure and hospitality, and financial activities.

**(3) Federal government employment.**
Employment of federal workers fell only 9,000 last month. That followed a decline of 4,000 in March. So far, the DOGE Boys haven’t had much impact on federal government employment. Solid gains were registered by health care and social assistance (58,200), transportation and warehousing (29,000), and leisure and hospitality (24,000). We acknowledge that the latter two could weaken if the trade war between China and the US persists.
 
**(4) Payroll employment diffusion index. **
It was encouraging to see that the payroll employment diffusion index remained above 50.0% during April)

#### Strategy: To Raise or Not To Raise Our S&P 500 Target? 
At the start of the year, our S&P 500 target for the end of this year was 7000. When we raised our odds of a recession on March 5 to 35%, we lowered our target to 6400. We lowered it again on March 31 to 6000, when we raised the odds of a recession to 45%.
 
Now that we are lowering the odds of a recession back to 35%, should we be raising our S&P 500 target back to 6400? We are inclined to do so given the power of the V-shaped rally in the S&P 500. However, we aren’t ready to do so given the following two issues:
 
**(1) Earnings. **
The outlook for S&P 500 earnings is deteriorating. Tariffs are first and foremost taxes on domestic importers. The 10% baseline tariff on all imports from most countries was announced by Trump on Liberation Day and imposed on April 5. There is also a 25% tariff on autos, aluminum, and steel. The 145% tariff on China remains in force as well.
 
Over the past 12 months through March, corporate tax receipts totaled $502.19 billion. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/0dbaf0fd-719131.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Federal Government - Tax Receipts on Corporate Income](https://en.macromicro.me/series/7201/us-federal-tax-on-corporate-income)*

The currently active tariff rates could raise over $300 billion in import duties over the coming 12 months. That would be a significant increased tax burden on corporate profits unless they are passed through to consumer prices. Some companies, such as those in the auto industry, might find that hard to do.
 
**(2) Valuation. **
The valuation multiple of the S&P 500 bottomed at 18.1 on April 8. It was back up to 20.5 on Friday.

### One Hundred Days of Attitude




[![One Hundred Days of Attitude](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/bc1d3611-305883.png)](https://pse.is/7j9nxm)





#### 1. Stocks Rally Globally as Risk Appetite Returns  
Global stock markets rebounded strongly last week, led by U.S. tech and industrial names. The S&P 500 rose nearly 3%, and the Nasdaq erased all losses since early April. Outside the U.S., Asian equities outperformed, with Taiwan's TAIEX up 4.6% and Japan's Nikkei rising over 3%. The sharp recovery signals a shift in investor sentiment toward riskier assets. Investors rotated out of safe havens like gold and into equities, suggesting growing optimism about global growth and policy stability. The rally also reflects improving earnings expectations and easing concerns over monetary tightening.

#### 2. Trump’s First 100 Days Bring Market Volatility and Policy Shifts  
President Trump’s second term has started with aggressive policy moves. In his first 100 days, he issued a record 143 executive orders and introduced controversial immigration and trade policies, sparking over 220 lawsuits. Market reaction has been mixed: the S&P 500 saw a sharp drawdown at one point, and disapproval ratings rose above approval. A shift from weak to strong dollar messaging also created uncertainty. Investors are watching how these rapid political moves will shape market direction, particularly around tariffs, fiscal policy, and legal risks.

#### 3. U.S. Credit Market Shows Stress, Especially in High-Yield Bonds  
The corporate bond market is sending warning signs. Investment-grade bonds returned +2.36% in Q1 2025, while high-yield barely managed +0.94%. The yield gap between A-rated and B-rated bonds has widened to 271 basis points, near cycle highs. This reflects investors demanding more compensation for risk as macro uncertainties rise. 

#### 4. BOJ Holds Rates Amid Weak Growth, While ECB Keeps Cutting  
The Bank of Japan held interest rates at 0.50%, even as it lowered its growth and inflation outlook due to global trade tensions. The yen weakened as markets interpreted the pause as dovish. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank continues its easing cycle, cutting rates seven times this year. Eurozone GDP beat expectations, but confidence across consumers and businesses is slipping. Inflation in Europe is falling, giving the ECB room to cut further. 

#### 5. Taiwan Dollar Surges to Record Weekly Gain  
The Taiwan dollar posted its strongest weekly gain ever, rising over 4% and briefly breaking below 30.5. This move reflects broad strength in Asian currencies and strong equity inflows into Taiwan’s tech-heavy stock market. While the U.S. Dollar Index remained stable, demand for risk assets pushed investors into regional currencies. Taiwan’s rally also suggests optimism around supply chain shifts and resilient export demand. However, such sharp currency appreciation could pressure Taiwan’s central bank to intervene or reassess its policy stance to maintain export competitiveness and manage inflation expectations.

"1142","CEO House View | Is the Bull Market Really Back? 3 Key Signals to Watch","ceo-house-view-trump-s-first-100-days-shake-markets-three-key-factors-to-stabilization","2025-05-02","Dear all,

Since Trump introduced reciprocal tariffs, global markets have experienced significant volatility in April. [Taiwan](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/46/tw-stock-relative/725/tw-mm-twse) equities, the [Vietnamese](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/1816/vietnam/15387/vie-stock-market) stock market, and the [Nikkei](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/72/jp-nikkei225/1108/mm-japan-stock-fundamental-index-plot) have suffered deeper losses due to tariff impacts. Interestingly, the [S&P 500](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/34/us-stock-relative/444/us-mm-gspc), after a month of sharp ups and downs, ended with only a -1.9% decline, while [India](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/141/mm-india/2195/mm-india-index)’s stock market reached a new high for the year. At the same time, the [U.S. Dollar Index](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/1767/us-dollar/14948/mm-dxy-expectation-index) fell notably below 100, long-term [U.S. Treasury yields](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/51/us-treasury-bond/761/us-10year-treasury-bond) fluctuated sharply—signaling market distrust of Trump’s actions—and [gold](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/45/mm-gold-price/749/mm-gold) prices hit a historic high this month.

We did not foresee the market shock triggered by Trump’s April 2nd announcement of reciprocal tariffs. However, rather than reacting with panic, worry, or herd mentality, our research team swiftly published a comprehensive [30+ page analysis](https://en.macromicro.me/blog/the-liberation-day-that-held-the-world-captive-a-full-analysis-of-trump-s-tariff-policy) on April 8th. We exercised prudence in calmly assessing likely scenarios, potential damage, and appropriate responses in the face of this major black swan event.


#### We believe April 2 marked the tariff ceiling—subsequent moves are likely to soften

In our [30+ page report](https://en.macromicro.me/blog/the-liberation-day-that-held-the-world-captive-a-full-analysis-of-trump-s-tariff-policy), we clearly highlighted the significant gap between Trump’s tariffs and their intended objectives, including the inevitable surge in inflation, increased fiscal deficits, and threats to the status of U.S. Treasuries. Consequently, whether Trump had pre-planned his strategy or his actions exceeded his own expectations, the conclusion remains the same: April 2 represented the worst of the tariff-related headwinds. Recent market developments also pressure Trump to soften his stance—evident from the continued dollar decline, growing concerns over U.S. debt, and notably steeper downgrades to U.S. economic forecasts compared to other economies (as seen in the macro forecast charts of our monthly report).

#### Global Relationships and Potential Scenarios

How will this “farce” end for various countries? In our recent [report](https://en.macromicro.me/blog/the-liberation-day-that-held-the-world-captive-a-full-analysis-of-trump-s-tariff-policy), we assessed potential outcomes for major economies. Broadly speaking, we expect most economies will negotiate tariff rates down to around 10%. Tariffs on China are likely to become tiered, with steep rates targeting strategic tech sectors, while easing measures may apply to consumer electronics and other products with strong U.S. demand—similar to the USMCA model.

We categorized these economies into three main groups. The first includes countries with low U.S. dependency—such as India, the Philippines, and Australia. These economies were minimally affected by the tariffs, with lower duties and rising stock markets. They may even benefit from supply chain relocation. The second group—Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea—have medium-to-high U.S. dependency but strategic value. These are likely to strike deals with the U.S. via investment and cooperation. While short-term relocation costs may disrupt supply chains, in the long run, these nations will remain aligned with and benefit from U.S. ties. The third group in the upper-right quadrant—Europe, Mexico/Canada, and Southeast Asia—will require longer negotiation periods. Europe and Mexico/Canada may ultimately shift supply chains in key industries like automobiles. Southeast Asia, especially Vietnam, is more vulnerable due to origin-label issues.

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1142/e0f36f4d-792503.png)

#### Strong Fundamentals in H1, Inventory Correction in H2: Fed and Treasury Actions Are Crucial

What does this mean for the fundamentals? Recent hard data shows firms are accelerating restocking and preemptively building inventories. Taiwan’s March [exports](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/13/tw-trade-relative/118/tw-exports-yoy) surged 18% YoY, U.S. [retail sales](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/3/us-consumption-relative/86/retail-sales) grew 4.6%, and [auto-related](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/3/us-consumption-relative/1136/retail-sales-excluding-energy) figures rose 8.8%—all reflecting a global restocking rush. This has both pros and cons. On the upside, it cushions the [inflationary shock](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/5/us-price-relative/10/cpi) when tariffs take effect. On the downside, it pulls forward demand, leading to heavier inventory de-stocking pressure in H2. The macro outlook is likely to enter a manufacturing downcycle, similar to the 2018–2019 period.

Looking ahead, market volatility will likely intensify in H2, with policy intervention becoming vital. The swift congressional passage of the Senate’s $1.5 trillion tax cut plan could enable tax relief as early as H2. The Fed may also pause balance sheet reduction by midyear and even cut rates in H2. A combined fiscal and monetary policy response could help ease manufacturing sector pressures.

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1142/78f7c63d-1468301.jpg)

---

### Investment Allocation & Focus Areas

Markets will undoubtedly navigate volatility this year, with mixed bullish and bearish signals. The core question remains: could things get worse?

If Trump’s tariff policy indeed softens as expected, the next focus is whether the post-restocking slump will push manufacturing into a downcycle. At that point, the ability of the Federal Reserve and Treasury to pivot toward supportive measures will be key. We believe the likelihood is high—both still have ample policy tools for gradual deployment in H2. For asset allocation, in addition to our recommended balanced mix of equities, bonds, and gold, investors may also consider shifting capital into regions and sectors benefiting from tariff realignment—such as the Indian market and defense stocks.

Finally, we advise investors to closely monitor three key signals, each of which could signal opportunity:

**1. If any country successfully reaches a deal with Trump, it would anchor his baseline, confirming that the worst of the tariffs has passed.**  
**2. Since soft data reacted first, tracking when soft data indicators—such as [inflation expectations](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/3/us-consumption-relative/22/consumer-confidence), [consumer confidence](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/3/us-consumption-relative/22/consumer-confidence), and [order indices](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/8/us-industry-relative/26281/ism-new-order-and-inventory)—stabilize will be critical.**  
**3. Look for signals from the Fed and Treasury regarding policy actions in H2.**  


Since this market panic is man-made, the recognition of its gravity opens the door to resolution. Looking forward, MacroMicro will continue to innovate. During these critical times, we’ve launched the MM Max package—a one-stop solution covering macro, industry, and equity data.

"1138","Yardeni Research | Anatomy Of A Correction","yardeni-research-anatomy-of-a-correction","2025-04-30","#### Executive Summary: 
A dovish faction has been forming within the Federal Reserve Board, dissenting from Chief Powell’s hawkish party line. Rather than wait and see whether tariffs deliver greater blows to the economic or the inflation outlook before changing monetary-policy course, the doves claim that the economy is more vulnerable and espouse lowering the federal funds rate sooner rather than later. Dr Ed sides with Powell & Co. So does the data: So far, there’s more evidence of tariff-induced inflationary pressures than economic weakness. ... Also: The recent stock market correction partly reflects late January’s revaluation of tech stocks in reaction to the Deep Six ramifications. Now investors may be embracing the Mag-7 once again … Check out the accompanying [chart collection](https://yardeni.com/wp-content/uploads/cc_20250428.pdf).

#### Fed I: Waller vs Powell. 
The financial markets have been obsessed with Trump’s Tariff Turmoil (TTT), and rightly so. That means that the financial markets have been less preoccupied with the Fed. Indeed, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled several times that monetary policy is on hold because of the uncertain economic effects of TTT. While the tariffs are likely to slow economic growth, they are also likely to boost inflation, at least temporarily.
 
Last Thursday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller publicly dissented from the relatively hawkish party line promoted by Powell & Co. in recent weeks. His dovish stance is that TTT is likely to weaken the labor market in coming months, while any inflationary pressures are likely to be temporary. So he is ready to lower interest rates sooner rather than later.
 
It’s becoming apparent that Waller is doing his best to ingratiate himself with Trump & Co. so he might be considered as a candidate to replace Powell when his term as Fed chair expires in May 2026. Stock investors liked what Waller had to say on Thursday. Joining Waller’s parade that day was Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack. In a separate interview, she said the central bank might reduce interest rates as early as June if it were to have clear evidence of the economy’s direction by then.
 
We side with Powell & Co. So far, the data show that consumer spending and the labor market remain remarkably resilient. At the same time, inflationary pressures are mounting, according to regional and national business surveys. Consumers’ inflationary expectations are also rising.
 
Let’s compare the recent comments coming from the Waller camp versus the Powell camp:
 
(1) “It wouldn’t surprise me that you might start seeing more layoffs, a tick up in the unemployment rate going forward if the big tariffs in particular come back on,” Waller said Thursday in an [interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-24/fed-s-waller-says-he-d-support-cuts-if-tariffs-drive-job-losses?srnd=homepage-americas&utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8TfkLStqTrv_b68zsd2Lmti5F7cz6ZAACe61GXF1VFpprzeYCiEeatSC-dNAaqv4mGerapqObuatNjLQffZYLHYhXfTA&_hsmi=2) on Bloomberg Television with Michael McKee. “I would expect more rate cuts, and sooner, once I started seeing some serious deterioration in the labor market.” Waller reiterated his view that the inflationary impact of Trump’s tariffs should be temporary. He first said so on April 14 in [remarks](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250414a.htm?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8TfkLStqTrv_b68zsd2Lmti5F7cz6ZAACe61GXF1VFpprzeYCiEeatSC-dNAaqv4mGerapqObuatNjLQffZYLHYhXfTA&_hsmi=2) prepared for an event in St. Louis.
 
(2) On Friday, April 11, a few days before Waller spoke in St. Louis, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams joined the chorus of Fed officials who’ve signaled their intent to keep rates on hold as they wait for more certainty about the impact of TTT. He [said](https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2025/wil250411?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8TfkLStqTrv_b68zsd2Lmti5F7cz6ZAACe61GXF1VFpprzeYCiEeatSC-dNAaqv4mGerapqObuatNjLQffZYLHYhXfTA&_hsmi=2), “During times of turbulence and uncertainty such as these, well-anchored longer-run inflation expectations are critically important for ensuring sustained price stability.” He added, “It is critically important to keep inflation expectations well anchored as we pursue our goals of maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2% longer-run objective.”
 
Also on April 11, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Boston Fed chief Susan Collins reiterated their views that Trump’s tariff policies may make rate cuts less likely this year.
 
(3) Of course, we give the most weight to the views of Fed Chair Powell. On July 16, in [prepared remarks](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250416a.htm?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8TfkLStqTrv_b68zsd2Lmti5F7cz6ZAACe61GXF1VFpprzeYCiEeatSC-dNAaqv4mGerapqObuatNjLQffZYLHYhXfTA&_hsmi=2) presented at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell observed, “Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation. The inflationary effects could also be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.”
 
Powell concluded, “For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.” Powell is apparently in less of a rush to lower rates than is Waller.
 
#### Fed II: More Inflation than Stagnation. 
So far, the data that the Fed depends on to make monetary policy is showing that TTT is boosting both consumer spending and inflationary pressures. Importers have been scrambling to front-run tariffs. The surge in imports depressed Q1’s real GDP growth rate, probably to +/-0.5% (saar).
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/4320efac-187131.png)

But Q2’s growth rate is likely to be 2.5%-3.0%, boosted by retail sales as consumers scramble to buy in advance of tariff-related price increases.
 
Meanwhile, the labor market remains strong. However, the regional and national business surveys are showing that higher prices-paid indexes are pushing up prices-received indexes, suggesting mounting inflationary pressures. Let’s review the latest data:
 
**(1) Consumers**. The Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) is among the softest of the soft economic data. Yet the hard data on consumers remain robust. The CSI fell in April to 59.8, matching previous cyclical lows that coincided with recessions. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/23e458b3-332508.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Consumer Confidence](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/3/us-consumption-relative/22/consumer-confidence)*

The CSI measures of expected inflation over the next 12 months and over the next five years jumped to 6.5% and 4.4%, respectively, in April.

 ▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - UMich Inflation Expectations](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/5/us-price-relative/22021/mit-expected-inflation-rate)*
 
These readings are well above the Fed’s 2.0% y/y inflation target. Inflationary expectations clearly are not “well anchored.”
 
Consumers are buying in advance of expected price increases. That’s plain to see in US total motor vehicle sales, which jumped to 17.8 million units (saar) during March, the highest pace since April 2021.

The Redbook retail sales index rose 7.0% y/y through the April 18 week.

 ▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Redbook Same-Store Retail Sales Index (YoY)](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/3/us-consumption-relative/23462/us-redbook-same-store-index)*

Interestingly, sales of discount stores is up 8.9%, but department-store sales is up only 2.4%.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/3c258c2c-191082.png)
 
**(2) Labor market.** We’ve often said that American consumers spend when they are happy and spend even more when they are depressed. Of course, that requires that they remain employed. They are currently extremely depressed according to the CSI, but they are still spending because they are still employed, as evidenced by the low readings for both initial and continuing unemployment claims so far this year through mid-April.

**(3) Inflation.** Consumers are right to be worrying about the inflationary consequences of TTT. The regional business surveys conducted by five of the Federal Reserve district banks are showing that prices-paid and prices-received indexes jumped sharply in March and April.

#### Strategy: The Magnificent-7 Are Still Magnificent. 
The latest correction in the S&P 500 was led by a short and shallow bear market in the Magnificent-7 stocks. Trump’s Tariff Turmoil clearly drove lots of the selling pressure. However, the stock market selloff this year was also attributable to the downward rerating of the elevated valuation multiples of S&P 500 Information Technology sector stocks, and particularly the Mag-7, which began after the release of open-source Deep Seek on January 24 triggered investor fear that capital spending on AI infrastructure would nosedive. Consider the following:
 
(1) SPY (the S&P 500 ETF) fell 19.0% from February 19 through April 8. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which is equal-weighted and rebalanced quarterly, dropped 26.7%, while the XMAG ETF (which is free-float cap-weighted) declined only 16.2% over this period.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/f4047366-131712.png)

 ▌*View Related Live Charts:  [Big Tech - Magnificent 7 CapEx (Cumulative Total)](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/109709/big-techs-m7-capex)*

Since April 8, SPY is up 10.9%, with MAGS up 14.8% and XMAG up 9.4%.
 
(2) The forward P/E of the Mag-7 plunged from 30.0 at the start of the year to 21.7 on April 8. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/3c7f414c-247827.png)
 ▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - S&P 500 - Forward PE Ratio](https://en.macromicro.me/series/20052/sp500-forward-pe-ratio)*

Over that same period, the forward P/E of the S&P 500 fell from 22.4 to 19.2, while the forward P/E of XMAG declined from 18.6 to 17.8. The forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of the Mag-7 plunged from 7.7 at the start of the year to 5.6 on April 8. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/32ad3467-1000365.png)

It is back up to 5.9. The forward P/S of the S&P 500 excluding the Mag-7 edged down from 2.2 to 2.1 over this same period through the April 17 week.
 
(3) While the Mag-7’s share of the S&P 500’s market capitalization has dropped from 32.0% at the start of the year to 28.4% currently, the Mag-7’s forward revenues and forward earnings share both are at new record highs of 11.8% and 22.6%.

(4) Also at a record high is the collective 26.2% forward profit margin of the Mag-7 at the end of April. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/020ec1de-803110.png)

That’s more than twice the 11.9% forward profit margin of the S&P 493!
 
(5) Analysts’ consensus expected (i.e., forward) short-term growth rates for the revenues and earnings of the S&P 500 have been declining since the start of this year, led by the Mag-7.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/406ad0d2-824279.png)

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/c34997ef-904235.png)

The forward revenues growth of the S&P 500 currently is at a still-solid 5.3%. The comparable series for the Mag-7 is down from 13.8% at the start of this year to 12.1% currently. The forward earnings growth rates of the S&P 500 and the Mag-7 currently are down a couple of percentage points since the start of this year to 11.5% and 17.2%, respectively. Those are still robust readings.
 
(6) The rebound in the stock market since April 8 was attributable to Trump’s postponing his reciprocal tariffs (except on China) and to his more moderate tone regarding the prospect of negotiating a trade deal with China. In addition, he backed off from his recent attacks on Fed Chair Powell.
 
Also positive: Investors may be returning to the Magnificent-7, which collectively is up 14.8% since April 8, outpacing the 9.4% increase in the XMAG since then. We’ve observed that AI is just the latest evolution of the Digital Revolution that started in the mid-1960s. It’s another technology that increases our ability to process more data faster and more cheaply. So it’s increasing the business of cloud computing companies and boosting their capital spending on cloud infrastructure.
 
(7) Alphabet’s Google Cloud Platform (GCP) results, reported last week, support our narrative. In Q1-2025, GCP reported revenue of $12.26 billion, slightly below Wall Street expectations of $12.27 billion but reflecting robust 28% y/y growth. Margins improved significantly to 17.8% from 9.4% a year ago, indicating better operational efficiency.
 
Heavy AI investments are paying off, with Google Cloud’s AI portfolio, powered by the Gemini large language model, attracting new customers and securing larger deals. Developer usage of Gemini doubled to 4.4 million users in six months by Q4-2024.
 
Capital expenditures are set to rise significantly, with Alphabet planning to spend $75 billion in 2025 (up from $52.5 billion in 2024) to expand its AI and data center infrastructure.

### The Art of the Fold: When the Trade War Dealing's Done


[![The Art of the Fold: When the Trade War Dealing's Done](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1139/cf2d2c77-320599.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19MMb8s_HPSnxPGdIA34woPo4CpQHEcZw/view?usp=sharing)





#### IMF Cuts Global Growth Outlook as Trade Tensions Rise
The IMF has cut its 2025 global GDP growth forecast to 2.8%, down from 3.3% in January and 3.2% in October 2024. The downgrade reflects rising trade tensions, mainly between the US and China. Higher tariffs are hurting business sentiment, delaying investments, and disrupting supply chains. Without tariff relief, downside risks could grow, leading to calls for coordinated action to support global demand and avoid a broader slowdown.

#### IMF Revises Inflation Forecasts: US Up, China Down

The IMF kept its 2025 global inflation forecast at 3.5%, but regional trends are diverging. Inflation in advanced economies is now seen at 2.4%, up 0.3 points, led by a US jump to 3.0% from 1.9%, as tariffs feed into consumer prices. Meanwhile, emerging market inflation was cut to 4.4%, with China’s forecast slashed by 1.7 points to 0.0%, signaling deflation risks. The gap makes monetary policy tougher—tightening pressure is building in the US and Europe, while some emerging markets may need to ease.

#### India on Track to Become World’s Third-Largest Economy by 2028
India’s limited trade exposure to the US and China positions it well amid global tensions. The IMF expects India to overtake Japan as the world’s fourth-largest economy in 2025 and surpass Germany by 2028. Strong growth, reforms, and foreign investment are fueling momentum. India's economic expectations index (6.33% in April vs. 1.75% for the US) and solid stock market gains show its relative resilience, making it a rare bright spot in a slowing global economy.

#### Will the Mar-a-Lago Accord Weaken the Dollar Long Term?
The Mar-a-Lago Accord, modeled after the 1985 Plaza Accord, aims to weaken the US dollar to boost exports and shrink the trade gap. Proposals include coordinated currency interventions and restructuring US debt by issuing ultra-long bonds. A weaker dollar could help manufacturing and cut deficits like it did in 1985, but it also risks hurting investor confidence and sparking legal challenges. The Dollar Index has already fallen below 99, its lowest since 2022. Keeping the dollar weak will require careful management to avoid capital flight and protect its reserve currency status.

#### Key Economic Reports to Watch This Week
April 30 will bring Q1 GDP data from the US and Eurozone, both expected at 1.0%. The US personal consumption report the same day will show if tariffs are pushing up consumer costs. Japan’s central bank is likely to hold steady amid trade uncertainty. Between April 29 and May 1, PMIs from the US, China, and Taiwan will gauge business sentiment under tariff pressures. Finally, US nonfarm payrolls on May 2 will offer an early look at labor market impacts from the trade war.

"1135","Yardeni Research | On Edge For 90 Days, More Or Less","yardeni-research-on-edge-for-90-days-more-or-less","2025-04-23","#### Executive Summary: 
Trump’s Tariff Turmoil has put the world on edge. A new world order may be the ultimate result, but for now we’ve got the New World Disorder, leaving everyone scrambling to adjust to Trump’s unpredictable policy pivots. The economic fallout is uncertain. The uncertainty is keeping Wall Street on edge. It’s keeping US trading partner nations on edge. It’s keeping YRI on edge. Today, Dr Ed reviews the timeline of Trump’s tariff proclamations; Trump’s frustrations with a Fed chair who won’t be cowed and can’t be fired; the mid-turmoil expectations for GDP, inflation, corporate earnings, and stock valuations; and the economic impacts of Trump’s tariffs on China and Europe. … Check out the accompanying [chart collection](https://yardeni.com/wp-content/uploads/cc_20250422.pdf).

#### On Edge I: Trump’s Tariffs. 
Everyone is on edge. That’s because President Donald Trump seems to be upending the Old World Order. So far, the result has been the New World Disorder, with a less clear distinction between America’s friends and foes. Under Trump’s America First policies, the US seems to have become a less dependable ally.
 
Henry Kissinger once said that “America has no permanent friends or enemies, only interests.” Yet Kissinger undoubtedly would have agreed that it is in America’s interests to have as many allies as possible. Trump doesn’t seem to share that world view. His is that America’s allies must accept that America’s interests come first before their own because the US is the world’s military and economic superpower.
 
Currently, global trade relations are being stressed by Trump’s tariffs. The resulting uncertainty has depressed global stock markets, especially since April 2 (“Liberation Day”). 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/87bc06b2-164585.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [World - MSCI Stock Indices 1-Month Return (USD)](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/100567/msci-global-indices-countries-1-month-return)*

No one can be certain whether Trump is using higher tariffs mostly as a negotiating tool to bring tariff and nontariff trade barriers down. Stock prices soared on April 9 after Trump postponed his reciprocal tariffs for 90 days on all countries except China (which is facing a 145% tariff).
 
The US is currently negotiating tariff agreements with 15 major economies; among them are Japan, the European Union, South Korea, and India. Additionally, 75 countries have reached out to the US expressing interest in trade negotiations. It is conceivable that Trump will announce trade deals by the July 1 deadline set by the 90-day pause, just a few days before US Independence Day. They are more likely to be in the form of letters of understandings or intentions rather than specific treaties, which would take much longer to negotiate. That should be good enough for Trump to declare victory. Or else, he might extend the pause for another 90 days. Anything is possible in the art of making deals.
 
Meanwhile, here is where things stand on the tariff front:
 
**(1) Steel.** A 25% tariff applies to all steel imports from all countries, with no exemptions or exclusions. This was reinstated and expanded to cover derivative products like nuts, bolts, and other downstream steel items.
 
**(2) Aluminum.** A 25% tariff is imposed on all aluminum imports globally, also without exemptions, covering derivative products such as automotive components and metal furniture.
 
**(3) Automobiles & auto parts.** A 25% tariff is in place on all imported cars, trucks, and certain auto parts from all countries, effective since April 3, 2025. Goods from Canada and Mexico that are compliant with Trump 1.0’s 2020 US–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) are exempt, but non-compliant goods from these countries face the tariff.
 
On April 14, Trump suggested that he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from tariffs that he previously had imposed, to give carmakers time to adjust their supply chains. The idea of a pause seems to stem from Trump’s comments about being “flexible” and not wanting to “hurt anybody,” but it’s unclear if this is just rhetoric or a signal of policy shift. Trump said car companies “need a little bit of time because they’re going to make ’em here.”
 
**(4) Non-USMCA goods from Canada & Mexico.** A 25% tariff applies to approximately 60% of Canadian goods and 50% of Mexican goods that do not comply with the USMCA trade agreement. This includes a wide range of products not specifically detailed but excludes energy from Canada (which faces a 10% tariff).
 
**(5) Other commodities.** Tariffs on copper, lumber, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors have been proposed or are under investigation; but as of now, no 25% tariff has been confirmed for these. The 25% tariff on selected commodities and products deemed as vital to national security appears to be permanent and non-negotiable.
 
The tech sector was thrown for a loop late on Friday, April 11, when Customs and Border Protection stated that about 20 products—including smartphones, computers, routers, and semiconductor chips—are exempt from the reciprocal tariffs. But two days later, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified that the exemptions are temporary and hinted that forthcoming tariffs on semiconductors will apply to other electronics too.
 
**(6) Nvidia.** On April 16, the Commerce Department confirmed that it introduced new export licensing requirements for AI chipmaker Nvidia, which is expected to take a $5.5 billion hit as a result. Also impacted is rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices.
 
**(7) Baseline tariff.** As of April 19, 2025, a 10% baseline tariff is in effect on all imported goods entering the United States from countries that maintain normal trade relations, except for goods specifically exempted or subject to higher tariffs (like the 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos, and non-USMCA goods from Canada and Mexico).
 
**(8) Port docking fee.** On April 17, 2025, CNBC reported that the Trump administration announced fees on Chinese ships docking at US ports. Later that same day, Reuters reported that the United States eased port fees on China-built ships after industry backlash.
 
#### On Edge II: Trump Vs Powell. 
President Trump has been frustrated by Fed Chair Jerome Powell since Trump’s first term in the White House. Trump nominated Powell to serve as Fed chair in 2017, replacing Janet Yellen. However, he soon soured on his pick, repeatedly attacking Powell on Twitter for raising interest rates too quickly.
 
In 2018, Trump was so frustrated with Powell that he asked Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to tell Powell “that I will repudiate his nomination, even though it has already been confirmed.” Ross claimed that after some pushback, he eventually did call Powell with the message. Powell shortly after did reverse his policy stance, but ostensibly in response to a weakening economy rather than political pressure. Trump went so far as to consider firing Powell in late 2018, an unprecedented move that could have risked roiling financial markets and compromising the Fed’s independence.
 
Trump’s Twitter tirades against Powell continued throughout 2018 and 2019, accusing the Fed chair of raising interest rates too fast and not doing enough to “juice the economy” to accommodate Trump’s trade war with China. However, Trump’s tone softened when the Fed did eventually ease monetary policy. Trump even expressed satisfaction with Powell’s performance in mid-2020.
 
Here we go again. Consider the following chronology of events in the relations between Trump and Powell this year:
 
**(1) February 5, 2025.** During an interview with Fox Business, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed that he and President Donald Trump were focused on the 10-year Treasury yield. He stated, “He and I are focused on the 10-year Treasury,” emphasizing that the administration’s priority was to lower these yields rather than pressuring the Fed to cut short-term interest rates.
 
**(2) April 4, 2025.** In a [speech](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250404a.htm?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ezOLAMxA2rhJc7LoRAMVhAruxRHoLOZnJUBNhljBgpBJusl8rGIt54OPyR7lVozOTw4i1RfOA9zPIF3SlxDmX112bcQ&_hsmi=2) two days after Liberation Day, Powell warned that as a result of Trump’s tariffs, inflation is likely to be more troublesome: “While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected. The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth. The size and duration of these effects remain uncertain. While tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation, it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome would depend on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, on the size of the effects, and on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices. Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.”
 
**(3) April 15, 2025.** Trump posted on Truth Social, criticizing Powell and urging the Fed to cut interest rates, stating, “The ECB [European Central Bank] is expected to cut interest rates for the 7th time, and yet, ‘Too Late’ Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete ‘mess’!”
 
**(4) April 16, 2025.** The next day, in a [speech](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250416a.htm?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ezOLAMxA2rhJc7LoRAMVhAruxRHoLOZnJUBNhljBgpBJusl8rGIt54OPyR7lVozOTw4i1RfOA9zPIF3SlxDmX112bcQ&_hsmi=2) at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell reiterated, “Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation. The inflationary effects could also be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. … We may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are in tension. If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal, and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close.”
 
**(5) April 17, 2025.** The next day, Trump responded to Powell’s speech. He intensified his attacks, explicitly calling for the Fed to cut interest rates and again demanding Powell’s termination, saying, “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough” and claiming that Powell was “always too late and wrong” on rate policy. He argued that lower rates were needed because “oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS.”
 
**(6) April 18, 2025.** On Friday, Trump criticized Powell again, stating that the Fed chair should lower interest rates. During a question-and-answer session with reporters, Trump said, “If we had a Fed chairman that understood what he was doing, interest rates would be coming down too,” and added, “He should bring them down.”
 
Trump would like Powell to resign before his term expires on May 2026. Powell won’t resign, and Trump doesn’t have the legal authority to fire him. Besides, there are 18 other participants on the FOMC with 11 other voting members on the committee who might dissent from any move to lower interest rates pushed by the next Fed chair Trump appoints after Powell’s term expires in May 2026.
 
In his April 16 speech, Powell concluded, “As that great Chicagoan Ferris Bueller once noted, ‘Life moves pretty fast.’”
 
#### On Edge III: US Economy. 
The US and global economies are also on edge over Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, which were announced on April 2 and postponed for 90 days on April 9. So Liberation Day II is now scheduled for July 1 and might or might not happen. The latest US economic “hard” data show that the economy remains resilient. The “soft” data are mostly in recession territory already. Our subjective probability of a recession remains at 45%, but we are on edge about it. Consider the following:
 
**(1) Recession & inflation consensuses.** On Friday, April 18, Polymarket.com showed that the risk of a recession in 2025 was 56%.

The latest quarterly [survey](https://www.wsj.com/economy/economists-outlook-recession-gdp-pce-unemployment-00d35eb3?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ezOLAMxA2rhJc7LoRAMVhAruxRHoLOZnJUBNhljBgpBJusl8rGIt54OPyR7lVozOTw4i1RfOA9zPIF3SlxDmX112bcQ&_hsmi=2) of economists by The Wall Street Journal was conducted from April 4 through April 8. The economists raised the consensus odds of a recession to 45% over the next 12 months, up from 22% in January. On average, they are expecting real GDP growth to be only 0.8% this year on a Q4/Q4 basis. That’s down from 2.5% last year.

The survey shows that economists are also expecting inflation to increase, with the core PCED climbing throughout the year to 3.6% y/y in December 2025, up from the 2.8% projected back in February. They see it moderating to 2.6% next year. For now, both our outlook for real GDP growth and inflation are close to the survey’s consensus, though we are more upbeat on growth.

**(2) Consumers.** We’ve often observed that when Americans are happy, they go shopping, and when they are depressed, they shop even more unless they lose their jobs. American consumers are extremely depressed currently; yet they continue to shop briskly, as the labor market remains remarkably strong. During the first half of April, the Consumer Sentiment Index fell to 50.8, exceeding previous cyclical lows during 1980, 1990, 2008, and 2022!

Most economists attributed the strong 1.4% m/m increase in retail sales during March to buying in advance of tariff-related increases. That could be quickly followed by a sharp retrenchment once consumer prices jump because of Trump’s tariffs.
 
We attribute some of the strength in March retail sales to a rebound from tougher-than-usual winter weather during January and February. Our view is supported by the record output of utilities during January and February that was following by a big drop in March.

**(3) Business activity.** Industrial production fell 0.3% m/m during March; manufacturing and mining outputs rose 0.3% and 0.6% m/m. Utilities fell 5.8% y/y, as temperatures were warmer than typical for the month.
 
The average of the April regional business surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Philadelphia dropped sharply, suggesting that the national M-PMI fell further below 50.0 in April.

The prices-paid and prices-received in both regional business surveys remain elevated. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/e9f57dba-1045058.png)

Together, the two surveys suggest a stagflationary outlook in coming months, resulting from Trump’s tariffs.
 
#### On Edge IV: Earnings & Valuation. 
Industry analysts are also on edge. They’ve gotten the tariffs-may-cause-recession memo and are scrambling to lower their 2025 and 2026 estimates for S&P 500 companies’ aggregate earnings per share. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/61b73196-160602.png)

They’ve lowered their 2025 consensus estimate to $266.02, down from $273.79 at the start of the year. Their current 2026 estimate of $304.11 is down from $309.97 at the start of this year. As a result, S&P 500 forward earnings peaked at a record high of $279.13 during the April 3 week and fell to $277.74 during the April 17 week.  (“Forward” earnings is the time-weighted average of the analysts’ consensus estimates for the current and coming years.)
 
We are still targeting EPS of $260 and $300 this year and next year. But we expect to be on the edge of lowering those numbers unless Trump’s Tariff Turmoil subsides significantly by July 1.
 
Not everyone is on edge. The one exception is the exceptional Warren Buffett, who has been a net seller of equities for the past nine quarters, resulting in Berkshire Hathaway's ending 2024 with a record $334 billion in cash and equivalents. Buffett stayed true to his favorite valuation metric, i.e., the so-called “Buffett Ratio,” which is the total market value of US corporate equities divided by nominal GDP.

It is a quarterly series. The comparable weekly series is the price-to-sales ratio of the S&P 500, which soared from 2.0 at the start of the latest bull market to 3.0 when the S&P 500 peaked on February 19. It is back down to 2.6, which is still a high valuation reading, especially if a recession becomes more likely.  
 
#### On Edge V: China. 
The Chinese government is also on edge. It is trying to provide more domestic economic stimulus to offset the depressing impact of Trump’s trade war. So far, the Chinese government’s 10-year bond yield has dropped back down to recent record lows following a very brief rebound.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [China - 10-Year Government Bond Yield](https://en.macromicro.me/series/1849/china-bond-10-year)*

We agree with the Chinese bond market’s assessment that the government’s stimulus measures won’t offset the deflationary effects of a trade war with the US combined with the ongoing weakness in China’s property market.
 
#### On Edge VI: Europe. 
Europeans are on edge, too. The immediate impact of Trump’s trade war has been to weaken the dollar, mostly because of a flight to the euro.

A strong euro is bad news for the sales and earnings of European companies. A strong euro will put downward pressure on Eurozone inflation, but it will also raise the risk of deflation as China’s manufacturers dump more of their excess capacity in Europe now that the US market is effectively closed to them.

### All That Glitters Is Indeed Gold: Trade Wars, Tech Booms, & Gold’s Record Run—What’s Next?



[![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1133/a60020e8-291953.jpg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c_vFvg8itHrH-cMb6--Lg0wEKEIGVFNr/view?usp=sharing)





#### Gold Soars to $3,400 as Safe Havens Shift

Gold futures have shattered records, soaring to $3,400/oz with a 25% YTD gain, as U.S.-China trade fears and a declining share of U.S. debt held overseas drive investors to safety—central banks alone added 300 tons in 2024, the most since 2012. Yet, with volatility spiking and liquidity risks looming, is a correction on the horizon?

#### Semiconductors Face Trade War Heat

TSMC’s Q1 revenue surged 35.3% YoY to $25.5B, fueled by AI demand as its HPC segment hit 59% share, but a U.S. national security probe and China’s 125% chip tariffs threaten global supply chains—especially with China’s IC production up 90% YoY. Can the tech boom withstand the tariff storm?

#### U.S. Retail Booms—For Now

U.S. retail sales jumped 1.43% MoM in March—the highest since Jan 2023—as consumers stockpiled ahead of tariffs, with auto sales soaring 5.31% and inventory days dropping to 70. But with tariff price hikes looming after the July 9 suspension ends, will spending hold—or will the Fed’s 100bps rate cuts in 2025 cushion the fall?

"1128","Yardeni Research | Bonds Away!?","yardeni-research-bonds-away","2025-04-16","#### Executive Summary:

Long-term Treasury bond yields surged last week despite news that March inflation was subdued and consumer sentiment is falling fast. That’s partly because the federal budget deficit is too d@mn high! In the past, recessions and lower long-term bond yields were associated with higher deficits; but the budget deficit has been widening since Covid despite a growing economy. Supply of long-term bonds also affects yields, but less so since the Treasury Department started issuing more short-term debt in 2023. Observers have been perplexed by the rise in long-term yields, but the reason for it may simply be that global demand for US Treasury bonds has shriveled, as Trump’s Tariff Turmoil is raising inflationary expectations. … Check out the accompanying [chart collection](https://yardeni.com/wp-content/uploads/cc20250414.pdf).

#### Bonds I: Kerfuffle.

Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-11/dimon-predicts-treasury-market-kerfuffle-where-fed-steps-in?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--mTpS4DdIuUOuVql8_13XDaUN3o2HPdpOhvw-QZ6XyJRCgOZUQCljMy253oeGapdI_dKJTSRVE6Ye9BZa03JUoD-B9Ow&_hsmi=2) that JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon said on the company’s Friday earnings call: “There will be a kerfuffle in the Treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations. When that happens, the Fed will step in—but not until ‘they start to panic a little bit.’ He added, ‘When you have a lot of volatile markets and very wide spreads and low liquidity in Treasuries, it affects all other capital markets. That’s the reason to do it, not as a favor to the banks.’”

There has already been a kerfuffle in the bond market since April 2, i.e., on President Donald Trump’s self-proclaimed “Liberation Day,” when he announced higher-than-expected reciprocal tariffs on 60 countries, including an island populated only by penguins. The tariffs were scheduled to take effect on April 9, when they were postponed for 90 days because of the bond market’s kerfuffle. The tariffs on China, however, were implemented. The 25% tariff on aluminum, steel, and autos remained in place.

Trump acknowledged that he postponed the tariffs because of the bond market’s kerfuffle. The 10-year Treasury bond yield did fall slightly during April 3 and April 4 to 4.01%. But then it climbed to 4.49% on Friday, April 11. That happened despite lower-than-expected March Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) readings on April 10 and April 11. Even the sharp drop in consumer sentiment during the first two weeks of April (reported on April 11) didn’t stop the bond yield from moving higher, as it would have in normal times.

The problem is that Trump’s Tariff Turmoil (TTT) is expected to be inflationary, as evidenced by the big jump in consumers’ inflationary expectations during the first two weeks of April. This means that rising inflation likely would delay any Fed easing to avert a recession. Fed officials aren’t about to lower the federal funds rate (FFR) anytime soon, as they have been saying since the beginning of the year. In an April 4 [speech](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250404a.htm?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--mTpS4DdIuUOuVql8_13XDaUN3o2HPdpOhvw-QZ6XyJRCgOZUQCljMy253oeGapdI_dKJTSRVE6Ye9BZa03JUoD-B9Ow&_hsmi=2), Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested that they’re in even less of a hurry to do so now than before TTT, since the tariffs turned out to be higher than widely expected:

“While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected. The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth. The size and duration of these effects remain uncertain. While tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation, it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome would depend on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, on the size of the effects, and on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices. Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.”

So bond investors may be in no rush to buy bonds, especially since they may not be convinced that Washington will do enough to reduce the federal deficit.

On Friday and Saturday, Trump continued to back off from his tariffs, which he has described as “a beautiful thing.”

#### Bonds II: The Yellen/Bessent Short-Term Solution to Debt.

I have been on Wall Street for more than 45 years. Over that period, there has been a lot of concern about mounting federal deficits and debt. Along the way, some of us bond market watchers observed that bond yields tended to decline when federal budget deficits widened during recessions; that’s because recessions caused the federal government’s revenues to decline, as Americans’ incomes and profits fell, and the government’s outlays to be boosted by its income support programs. Deficits were mostly counter-cyclical, widening during recessions and narrowing during expansions.

No big deal.

Yet starting in the 1980s, there were mounting concerns that federal government debt was rising relative to nominal GDP as deficits continued even during periods of economic expansion.

Lots of articles and books have been written since the 1980s about the likely terrible consequences of so much government debt rising so rapidly. Stock and bond market bears often included the federal deficits and debt in their litany of reasons to be cautious. I tended to be mostly bullish on stocks and bonds in the past. With regards to federal government deficits and debt, I argued that I would worry about them when the bond market worried about them.

I did briefly worry in 2023, when the 10-year Treasury bond yield jumped from 4.00% on August 9 to 5.00% on October 19.
![](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1128/7bbeb300-166282.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - 10Y Treasury Yield vs. Price](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/51/us-treasury-bond/761/us-10year-treasury-bond)*

This resulted from bond investors’ response to a series of Treasury auction size increases starting in August 2023, with quarterly refunding auctions for 3-, 10-, and 30-year maturities reaching $125 billion. These poorly received auctions heightened fears that a debt crisis was imminent. The bond market was choking on the supply of bonds, forcing yields up to levels that could cause a recession.

On November 1, 2023, the US Treasury, under Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, announced a reduction in the pace of increases for longer-dated Treasury securities, easing the supply of new bonds. Yellen’s strategy leaned heavily on issuing short-term Treasury bills to meet borrowing needs. The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, which advises the Treasury Department on matters related to the issuance of federal securities, has been recommending that no more than 20% of the Treasury’s marketable debt should be held in Treasury bills.
![](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1128/0a428d17-158265.png)

Yellen took the ratio up to 22%.

This tactic was criticized by some, including current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, for potentially keeping borrowing costs artificially low ahead of the 2024 election. When Bessent took over as Treasury secretary in early 2025, he initially criticized Yellen’s approach, arguing it shortened debt maturities too much and clashed with the Federal Reserve’s inflation goals. However, on February 5, 2025, the Treasury under Bessent announced that it would maintain Yellen’s guidance, keeping longer-term debt issuance unchanged at $125 billion for quarterly refunding auctions spanning 3-, 10-, and 30-year maturities, with no increases expected for “at least the next several quarters.”

“He and I are focused on the 10-year Treasury,” Bessent said in a February 5 interview with Fox Business when asked about whether President Trump wants lower interest rates. “He is not calling for the Fed to lower rates.”

Bessent explained his continuation of Yellen’s plan in a February 20, 2025, Bloomberg Television interview, stating that any shift to Treasury’s issuing new debt with longer maturities was “a long way off” due to market conditions, inflation, and the Fed’s quantitative tightening. He suggested a gradual approach, as flooding the market with long-term bonds could spike yields and borrowing cost.

I will not be surprised if Bessent addresses the recent turmoil in the Treasury bond market by reducing the size of Treasury bond auctions, thus financing even more of the deficit with Treasury bills. The next quarterly refunding announcement is scheduled for April 30. That would certainly push bond yields lower. In effect, this would amount to a policy of Yield Curve Control by the Treasury (YCC-T) rather than the Fed (YCC-F).

As a thought experiment, what if the Treasury issued only Treasury bills? The Fed would be forced to buy a significant amount (if not all) of them to keep the FFR from rising above its range. Bond yields would fall dramatically unless inflationary pressures resulted, in which case the Fed would have to raise the FFR range. That would immediately increase the cost of financing the Treasury’s debt. Might that put pressure on Congress and the White House to reduce the deficits? Probably not, because YCC-T would effectively bury the Bond Vigilantes.

#### Bonds III: Staying Vigilant.

Since the start of this year, I’ve been arguing that the 10-year US Treasury bond yield has normalized and is likely to trade in a range of 4.25%-4.75% for the rest of this year. I flinched after Liberation Day and lowered the range to 3.75%-4.25%. But now, I am raising it back to 4.25%-4.75%, which is where the bond yield mostly traded in the years just before the Great Financial Crisis.

So the recent increase in the yield doesn’t faze me. But it has fazed lots of other market observers. Indeed, I’ve been fielding lots of calls from financial market journalists wondering whether the Bond Vigilantes are back on the scene. The answer is “no” if the bond yield simply has normalized. Then again, the recent jump in yields has been fast and furious, suggesting that the Bond Vigilantes are back and that on Wednesday of last week they forced the Trump administration to postpone imposing reciprocal tariffs on numerous countries around the world for 90 days.

The Bond Vigilantes are rightly concerned that Trump’s Nitro Tariffs (TNT) will cause an explosive increase in inflation. They are also concerned that the recent weakness in the dollar suggests that foreigners are selling their US bonds. And the Bond Vigilantes might be signaling that they aren’t convinced that the Trump administration will rein in the federal deficit.

The good news is that Treasury Secretary Bessent seems to have convinced President Trump that they shouldn’t mess with the Bond Vigilantes. On Wednesday, April 9, after ratcheting back all reciprocal tariffs to 10% for at least 90 days (but upping the pressure on China with a 145% tariff), Trump said: “I was watching the bond market. The bond market is very tricky, I was watching it. But if you look at it now it’s beautiful. The bond market right now is beautiful. … I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy.”

Trump also said he listened to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s [interview](https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6371265074112?ref=yardeniquicktakes.com&utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--mTpS4DdIuUOuVql8_13XDaUN3o2HPdpOhvw-QZ6XyJRCgOZUQCljMy253oeGapdI_dKJTSRVE6Ye9BZa03JUoD-B9Ow&_hsmi=2) last Wednesday with Fox’s Maria Bartiromo, in which Dimon said a recession was likely and the bond market was sending bad signals about stress in the financial plumbing.

President Bill Clinton had a similar epiphany in 1993 after his advisor James Carville said: “I used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the President or the Pope or as a .400 baseball hitter. But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.”

#### Bonds IV: Supply & Demand.

Everyone in our business seems to be wondering why the 10-year Treasury bond yield has been rising in recent days.

The widely accepted view is that hedge funds had to unwind basis trades by selling bonds when the yield became volatile in response to TNT. But also among the usual roundup of suspects is the Chinese government, which might be selling Treasuries in retaliation against Trump’s 145% tariff on goods imported from China.

Reporter Jon Sindreu came up with a clever explanation in an [article](https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/the-simple-explanation-for-this-weeks-treasury-market-mayhem-9351f339?mod=panda_wsj_author_alert&utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--mTpS4DdIuUOuVql8_13XDaUN3o2HPdpOhvw-QZ6XyJRCgOZUQCljMy253oeGapdI_dKJTSRVE6Ye9BZa03JUoD-B9Ow&_hsmi=2) posted by The Wall Street Journal on April 11 titled “The Simple Explanation for This Week’s Treasury Market Mayhem.” He wrote: “But the answer might be far simpler: U.S. government debt is doing badly because, well, investors don’t want to buy it.” In other words, bond yields are rising because there are fewer buyers than sellers of US Treasury bonds.

Consider the following:

(1) The biggest seller of those bonds, of course, is the US Treasury. Yet Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/us-treasury-10-year-note-auction-outcome-shows-strong-demand-2025-04-09/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--mTpS4DdIuUOuVql8_13XDaUN3o2HPdpOhvw-QZ6XyJRCgOZUQCljMy253oeGapdI_dKJTSRVE6Ye9BZa03JUoD-B9Ow&_hsmi=2) on April 9: “A U.S. Treasury debt auction of $39 billion in benchmark 10-year notes was well received on Wednesday, showing solid investor demand even after a bond market sell-off driven by an escalating trade war between the United States and its major trading partners led by China. The U.S. Treasury’s auction came in better than expected, priced at a high yield of 4.435%, lower than the rate forecast at the bid deadline.” Indirect buyers, a category that typically includes foreign central banks and private investors, bought 87.9% of the supply allotted to them, above the average of 70%.

(2) March’s CPI and PPI inflation rates were lower than expected, we learned when released on Thursday and Friday. Yet the bond market wasn’t impressed. That’s because on Thursday, the Treasury Department reported that the federal deficit was $2.1 trillion over the 12 months through March, and on Friday the Survey Research Center reported that the Consumer Sentiment Survey showed that consumers’ year-ahead expected inflation had soared to 6.7% last month, the highest rate recorded since 1981.

(3) Bessent should explain to the President that the balance of payments always balances. The flip side of America’s current account deficit are net capital inflows.
![](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1128/ef4e1547-137815.png)

So for example, last year, the former totaled $1.13 trillion, while the latter totaled $1.26 trillion. This suggests that if Trump succeeds in reducing the trade deficit, foreigners will have fewer dollars with which to buy US Treasuries and other securities.

Over the 12 months through January, US net capital inflows from foreign private investors and central banks totaled $1.16 trillion.
![](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1128/ec469925-184022.png)

Over that same period, private net purchases of bond and equities by foreign entities totaled $881.8 billion and (a record) $435.2 billion.

### Tariff Roulette: Where Will the Trade Policy Land?



[![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/edms/2025-04/5008ee5e-931664.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13u4SwnA7YuK5OiZLSWaVFVKjwmt3MO2n/view?usp=sharing)





#### Global Market Volatility: 

Global equity markets saw a sharp rebound, particularly in U.S. tech stocks, due to policy shifts such as Trump’s temporary pause on reciprocal tariffs. However, Asian markets, especially Taiwan and Hong Kong, lagged behind due to escalating trade tensions.

#### U.S. Treasury Sell-Off: 

U.S. Treasuries faced a significant sell-off, with the 10-year yield rising sharply. This was driven by concerns over U.S. credit risk, forced deleveraging, and China’s reduced holdings of Treasuries, leading to instability in bond markets.

#### Contradictions in Trump’s Tariff Strategy

Trump's extreme tariff approach, intended to boost domestic production, is creating stagflationary pressures, harming economic growth while driving up inflation. This approach is seen as contradictory to its goal of reducing the trade deficit, which could worsen fiscal imbalances.

"1124","Yardeni Research | Annihilation Days","yardeni-research-annihilation-days","2025-04-09","#### Executive Summary: 
Trump’s Liberation Day last Wednesday triggered Annihilation Days on Thursday and Friday, with the Stock Market Vigilantes giving a costly thumbs-down to Trump’s Reign of Tariffs. Trump officials say they aim to make Main Street wealthy again even if that’s bad for Wall Street. The problem is that Main Street owns lots of equities traded on Wall Street, so the two streets prosper and suffer together. Congress can’t do much to stop Trump given his veto power, but he might get the message that hurting Main Street’s stock portfolios can cause a recession and jeopardize the GOP majority in Congress. If so, he might postpone the reciprocal tariffs, giving trade negotiations time to work. Also, the courts might block Trump’s tariffs. An early end to Trump’s tariff nightmare would result in a V-shaped stock-market bottom. We’re counting on that; the alternative is just plain ugly. … Check out the accompanying [chart collection](https://yardeni.com/wp-content/uploads/cc_20250407.pdf).

#### Trump’s Tariffs I: President’s Exit Ramp. 
So far, congressional Republicans are giving Trump Tariffs 2.0 the benefit of the doubt. Some are voicing their concerns. A few Senate Republicans are joining the Democrats in the Senate to support a bill to cancel Trump’s tariffs on Canada. But it won’t pass in the House, and Trump has already said that he won’t sign it.
 
Meanwhile, the Stock Market Vigilantes aren’t giving Trump Tariffs 2.0 the benefit of the doubt. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq plunged 9.9% and 10.7% from April 1, i.e., the day before Liberation Day through Friday’s close.

They are now down 17.4% and 22.7% from their respective record highs on February 19 and December 16.
 
In other words, Liberation Day has been followed by Annihilation Days in the stock market.
 
On Saturday morning, I nearly gagged on my bagel listening to a CNN [*interview*](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/05/business/video/smr-stocks-plunge-as-tariff-chaos-rocks-markets?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9XmRMjxxr5zF31M6m0DCQcpDzrogwLCsNMrTiHnElhtKX-oA5O-eMA9rjR69ntBaZyQ-5J1q_IN8aJPbPziWLzLTYymA&_hsmi=2) with Peter Navarro. The President’s senior counselor for trade and manufacturing declared that the tariffs are aimed at benefiting Main Street, not Wall Street. Other senior officials in the Trump administration, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have said the same.
 
I have news for them: Wall Street is Main Street. Wall Street matters a great deal to Main Street. Main Street owns lots of stocks in American corporations that are facing massive disruptions as a result of Trump Tariffs 2.0. Navarro predicted that the stock market will bottom “soon” and that the stock market rally will broaden to include the S&P 493 and not just the Magnificent 7. Navarro also predicted that the Dow Jones will rise to 50,000 by the end of Trump’s term. He implored the media to accentuate the positives of Trump’s tariffs. In fact, the media was just as surprised by last week’s stock market rout as were Wall Street and Main Street.
 
Congress is about to get an earful. Main Street undoubtedly will voice our anger about the immediate adverse effects of Trump’s tariffs on our investment and retirement portfolios. Senior citizens who have retired or were planning to do so must be especially mad. The administration’s response is that the short-term pain will be worth the long-term gain. The problem is that Americans don’t do pain very well and aren’t convinced that the eventual gain will be worth it. So the pressures on congressional representatives from their constituencies to stop the tariff madness will be intense in coming days, especially if the stock market continues to crash.
 
Trump needs an exit strategy. The obvious one is for him to declare victory. He can keep his 10% base tariff on imports from all countries while delaying implementation of the reciprocal tariffs on countries that agree to negotiations. The stock market undoubtedly would rebound sharply if he were to do that.
 
There is some good news regarding tariffs. The Vietnamese reportedly are ready to drop their 90% tariffs. Argentina wants to go down to 0%. India and South Korea are negotiating with the White House. In February, the European Union considered dropping its auto tariff from 10.0% to 2.5%, and offered to buy American energy and weaponry to avoid Trump’s tariffs. Now, however, the EU is planning countermeasures to the new US tariffs. That could be the next shoe to drop on the stock market. Indeed, the EU was already finalizing a first package of tariffs on up to €26 billion ($28.4 billion) of US goods for mid-April in response to the US's steel and aluminum tariffs that took effect on March 12.
 
Meanwhile, as I noted in Friday’s QuickTakes, Trump’s tariffs are bound to be challenged in courts:
 
(1) The first case has been started by the [*New Civil Liberties Alliance*](https://nclalegal.org/who-we-are/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9XmRMjxxr5zF31M6m0DCQcpDzrogwLCsNMrTiHnElhtKX-oA5O-eMA9rjR69ntBaZyQ-5J1q_IN8aJPbPziWLzLTYymA&_hsmi=2) (NCLA) on behalf of a small retail stationery business named “Simplified.” Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-04/trump-sued-over-tariffs-by-small-us-firm-claiming-severe-harm?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9XmRMjxxr5zF31M6m0DCQcpDzrogwLCsNMrTiHnElhtKX-oA5O-eMA9rjR69ntBaZyQ-5J1q_IN8aJPbPziWLzLTYymA&_hsmi=2): “The lawsuit filed in federal court in Florida may be the first legal challenge to the sweeping new US tariffs. ... ‘By invoking emergency power to impose an across-the-board tariff on imports from China that the statute does not authorize, President Trump has misused that power, usurped Congress’s right to control tariffs, and upset the Constitution’s separation of powers,’ Andrew Morris, senior litigation counsel at NCLA, said in a statement announcing the suit. The complaint seeks a court order declaring the tariffs unconstitutional and finding that they were adopted in violation of US administrative rules.”
 
(2) Other business groups are considering similar challenges. Politico [*reports*](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/04/first-lawsuit-filed-against-trumps-tariffs-00273646?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9XmRMjxxr5zF31M6m0DCQcpDzrogwLCsNMrTiHnElhtKX-oA5O-eMA9rjR69ntBaZyQ-5J1q_IN8aJPbPziWLzLTYymA&_hsmi=2): “At issue is a nearly-50-year-old law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, that Trump is citing to impose both the duties on China and the global ‘reciprocal tariffs’ he announced this week. The 1977 law gives the president broad authority to respond to a national emergency. But Trump is the first president to use it to impose tariffs, which is a power the U.S. Constitution assigned to Congress.”
 
Might the Fed come to the rescue and provide enough monetary easing to offset the deflationary consequences of Trump’s tariffs? On Friday, Trump posted the following on Truth Social: “This would be a PERFECT time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut Interest Rates. He is always ‘late,’ but he could now change his image, and quickly. Energy prices are down, Interest Rates are down, Inflation is down, even Eggs are down 69%, and Jobs are UP, all within two months - A BIG WIN for America. CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!”
 
Also on Friday, shortly after Trump’s plea, Powell told business journalists in Arlington, Virginia, that the Fed is in no hurry to cut the federal funds rate. He said the Fed faces a “highly uncertain outlook” because of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. He also said that the tariffs announced were “significantly larger than expected.” In his [*prepared remarks*](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250404a.htm?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9XmRMjxxr5zF31M6m0DCQcpDzrogwLCsNMrTiHnElhtKX-oA5O-eMA9rjR69ntBaZyQ-5J1q_IN8aJPbPziWLzLTYymA&_hsmi=2), Powell stated: “Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem. … We are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance. It is too soon to say what will be the appropriate path for monetary policy.”
 
In other words, “Fuhgeddaboudit” was Powell’s response to Trump.
 
That was also Powell’s message to the financial markets. Nevertheless, by the end of trading on Friday, the financial futures market signaled that it expects two to three 25bps rate cuts over the next six months and four to five rate cuts over the next 12 months.

#### Trump’s Tariffs II: Nero Golfs. 
In his CNN interview Saturday morning, Navarro claimed that thanks to Trump’s policies, the price of oil has dropped sharply, thus reducing the price of gasoline.

He was making the debatable claim that the pain the tariffs are causing for stock investors has been more than offset by the gain of lower gasoline prices and mortgage rates. In addition, he stated that a few companies and countries have recently committed to spend trillions of dollars on capital investments in the US.
 
The Great Crash during the Great Depression was also accompanied by plunging commodity prices and interest rates. So it is hard to take comfort from last week’s drop in commodity prices and interest rates. The administration can’t take any credit for falling commodity prices and interest rates if the reason they are falling is that the administration’s tariff policies are causing a recession! Capital spending always declines during recessions even if spending commitments were made during good times.
 
The biggest risk to the economy currently, following last week’s stock market rout, is that the resulting negative wealth effect depresses consumer spending:
 
**(1) Total equity market capitalization. **
Data compiled by the Fed show that the total value of stocks traded in the US at the end of 2024 was $93 trillion. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1124/4b560600-171818.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [MM US Stock Fundamental Index](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/34/us-stock-relative/444/us-mm-gspc)*

At the end of Q1-2025, the total value of the S&P 500 was $50 trillion. So a 10% to 20% drop in this stock index would amount to a loss of $5 trillion to $10 trillion just in the S&P 500. That could have a significant negative wealth effect on US consumer spending, especially by retired and retiring Baby Boomers.
 
**(2) Who owns US equities? **
Of the $93 trillion in total equities, American households directly held $38 trillion at the end of Q4-2024. Mutual funds and ETFs held $24 trillion. Institutional investors including life insurance companies, private pension funds, and federal, state & local government retirement funds held $10.2 trillion. The rest of the world held $16.5 trillion.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1124/10159392-176608.png)
 
**(3) Households & Baby Boomers. **
The Fed also compiles data for the net worth of the household sector excluding nonprofit organizations. At the end of 2024, households held $46.8 trillion in corporate equities and mutual funds.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1124/1f087d4a-92815.png)

The Baby Boomers accounted for more than half of that at $25.2 trillion.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1124/43a06a56-86150.png)
 
At the end of last year, households held a record $15.2 trillion in IRAs. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1124/7247a404-115158.png)

Altogether, equities as a share of the assets held by households (including NPOs) rose to a record 43.5% during Q4-2025. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1124/3b518187-222846.png)

This means that they are more exposed to a negative wealth effect from falling stock prices. That’s what is happening on Main Street.
 
**(4) ‘Nero fiddles as Rome burns.’ **
On Friday, the President went to Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, before attending a fundraising dinner for a super PAC that backs Trump, MAGA Inc. On Saturday, he golfed at his course in Jupiter, where the Senior Club Championships are taking place. The White House reported that Trump “won his second round matchup of the Senior Club Championship ... and advances to the Championship Round tomorrow.”
 
The President wasn’t negotiating trade deals this weekend. He was too busy relaxing on the links.
 
#### Trump’s Tariffs III: Stress Testing a Resilient Economy. 
The plunge in stock prices since Liberation Day increases the odds that the resulting negative wealth effect will depress consumer spending, which increases the odds of a recession, which is, in turn, depresses stock prices. The odds of a recession according to Polymarket.com rose to 60% at the end of Friday.

It was at 42% on April 1.
 
We raised our subjective probability of a recession this year from 20% to 35% on March 5, and from 35% to 45% on March 31. Along the way, we also slashed our year-end target for the S&P 500 from 7000 to 6000 and cut our projection for 2025 S&P 500 earnings per share from $285 to $260. We also lowered our real GDP growth rate projection for this year from 2.5% to 3.0%, then down to 1.5%.
 
We expected Liberation Day to bring trouble. So for now, we aren’t changing our outlook or our odds of a recession. Call us delusional optimists, but we aren’t ready to bet against the resilience of the US economy in general or its consumers in particular. Of course, our big assumption is that Trump’s tariff nightmare will go away sooner rather than later, one way or another.
 
Meanwhile, let’s review the latest signs of the economy’s resilience; we acknowledge that they might be the last ones for a while if the nightmare persists:
 
**(1) Employment. **
We anticipated a strong rebound in March employment from the depressed gains during January and February, which we attribute to colder-than-normal weather. Nonfarm payrolls rose 228,000 during March.

Private services-providing industries increased their payrolls by 197,000. Aggregate weekly hours worked rose to a record 4.6 billion.

**(2) Retail sales. **
We also expect to see a rebound in March retail sales when it’s reported on April 16. We already know that auto sales jumped 11% m/m during March to 17.8 million units (saar), the highest since April 2021.

Some of that rebound undoubtedly reflected buying in advance of price increases resulting from Trump’s tariffs. April’s sales should also be very strong. But after that, sales could go over a cliff unless Tariff Man changes his mind."

Central to the outlook are the lasting effects of Trump’s tariff policies, designed to reshore U.S. manufacturing and counter China, which continue to play a pivotal role in economic stability. Alongside this, the rapid rise of AI is driving productivity across sectors, reshaping trade and labor markets. Despite ongoing uncertainties, the outlook emphasizes resilient manufacturing, shifting asset class dynamics, and India’s strategic position as a key beneficiary in the evolving tariff landscape.

#### 1. Trump’s Economic Policies Aim for Long-Term Stability Through Tough Measures.

Trump’s policies, spanning trade, foreign affairs, and domestic reform, aim to rebalance the global economic order and restore U.S. manufacturing. Despite expectations, he prioritized fiscal discipline over expansion to stabilize debt and reduce reliance on foreign capital. Post-2008, low interest rates and capital inflows bolstered U.S. markets, reinforcing dollar hegemony. However, persistent deficits, low savings, and foreign dependence created structural risks. The pandemic, inflation, and global de-dollarization trends exposed vulnerabilities. Trump responded with tariffs, tough stances on China, and support for crypto and industrial policy to reduce deficits and investment imbalances. Though aggressive short term, his strategy targets long-term stability.

---

#### 2. Trump’s Tariffs Target Strategic Leverage, Not Just Deficits

Trump’s tariff strategy prioritizes long-term U.S. national interests—reshoring manufacturing and countering China—over merely addressing fiscal or trade deficits. By wielding tariffs as a negotiation tool, he pressures global partners into concessions, delaying full implementation to secure deals rather than disrupt trade outright.

---

#### 3. U.S. Stocks Thrive on Domestic Demand and AI Adoption

Robust domestic demand continues to fuel U.S. equity gains, with non-tech sectors now sharing the spotlight as earnings rise across industries. AI adoption is accelerating this trend, with more companies integrating it into production and services, driving widespread upside potential.

---

#### 4. AI Transitions to Growth Phase, Far from Bubble Territory

AI is moving from its introductory stage into a growth phase, where lower costs and broader adoption mirror historical tech booms like the steam engine. Far from a bubble, this shift promises sustained demand as applications expand across industries.

---

#### 5. Manufacturing Stabilizes with Healthy Inventory Levels

The manufacturing cycle is leveling off, not collapsing, thanks to cautious post-pandemic inventory management. Low stock levels and steady export figures, like Taiwan’s, suggest resilience against a sharp downturn in the near term.

---

#### 6. U.S. Economy Holds Firm Against Tariff Headwinds

Trump’s radical immigration policy, while proposed to address labor shortages, has had a limited impact. Immigrants make up less than 20% of the workforce, and his proposed large-scale deportations were not as severe as anticipated. Despite his push for fiscal discipline, the labor market has returned to equilibrium, with low-skilled job wages stabilizing. Immigration controls are less impactful, as the labor market no longer faces a supply-demand imbalance. Federal employment, especially in military-related sectors, limits large cuts. The March Federal Reserve update reflects economic uncertainty, with rate cuts possible after tariff uncertainties resolve, signaling cautious policy adjustments.

---

#### 7. AI Boosts Productivity Across Diverse Sectors

AI’s integration into software, hardware, and services is driving productivity beyond tech, with firms like Nvidia seeing gains in automotive and robotics. This broadening adoption signals a balanced economic uplift, not just a tech-centric surge.

[![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/4936f49a-613006.png)](https://en.macromicro.me/video)

---

#### 8. Geopolitical Strategy Shapes U.S. Trade Moves

Trump’s trade policies leverage tariffs to bolster alliances, notably with India, and secure critical industries like semiconductors and rare earths against China. This approach prioritizes geopolitical positioning, using America’s consumer market as a bargaining chip.

---

#### 9. Uncertainty and Rotation Highlight Asset Class Dynamics

Research indicates evolving performance patterns across asset classes amid current uncertainties and sector rotations. Corporate bonds, supported by strong balance sheets, are displaying different yield characteristics compared to government debt, while equity markets continue to respond to AI integration and manufacturing trends.

---

#### 10. India Rises as a Tariff War Beneficiary

India emerges as a winner in Trump’s tariff negotiations, trading its vast consumer market for strategic U.S. support in the Indo-Pacific. Rapid agreements and potential industrial upgrades position India to capitalize on this shift, unlike export-heavy peers facing tougher scrutiny.

The expected fallout from Trump 2.0’s Reign of Tariffs undercuts our former bullishness and dims the prospects of our base-case Roaring 2020s scenario for now. It has also drained confidence in the US economy on the parts of everyone from CEOs to consumers to investors. Recent data showing manufacturing faltering and purchasing managers paying higher prices suggest stagflation is already taking root. We’re dropping the odds we assign to our Roaring 2020s scenario from 65% to 55% and upping the odds of a stagflation scenario, which may include a recession, from 35% to 45%. That 45% is also the probability we see that the stock market’s correction will deepen into a bear market in coming months. Yet we still expect an up year, with the S&P 500 rising above 6000 by year-end. … Check out the accompanying [chart collection](https://yardeni.com/wp-content/uploads/cc20250331.pdf).

#### Reign Of Tariffs I: Losing Confidence. 
Does President Donald Trump want a recession? He is going to get one if he continues to pursue his chaotic tariff policies. Consider the following:
 
**(1) CFOs & CEOs.** 
According to a recent small [survey](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/25/recession-is-coming-pessimistic-corporate-cfos-say-cnbc-survey.html?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8iV5PPHryIERrTWJ3GAuEBrcWy90ND6miVNJXXNnw4QAhsTR-FfkwnpAzYhm5SRkX_0gLcFy6w_6_rKgcM7Yuf8iiFbQ&_hsmi=2) of chief financial officers conducted by CNBC and discussed in a March 25 CNBC [post](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/25/recession-is-coming-pessimistic-corporate-cfos-say-cnbc-survey.html?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8iV5PPHryIERrTWJ3GAuEBrcWy90ND6miVNJXXNnw4QAhsTR-FfkwnpAzYhm5SRkX_0gLcFy6w_6_rKgcM7Yuf8iiFbQ&_hsmi=2): “In a word, the ‘pessimism’ has crept back in where the animal spirits had been after Trump’s election. That’s one way to sum up the results from the latest CNBC CFO Council quarterly survey for Q1 2025.”
 
Ninety percent of the surveyed CFOs say tariffs will cause “resurgent inflation.” The majority of the CFOs expect a recession in the second half of 2025. They should know: The CFO Council survey is a sampling of views from CFOs at large organizations across sectors of the US economy. The Q1 survey covered replies from 20 respondents and was conducted between March 10 and March 21.
 
The Business Roundtable CEO Economic Outlook Index dipped modestly during Q1. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/60b6082a-185768.png)

In a special question posed this quarter, chief executive officers were asked to identify policies and actions that are important for strengthening domestic manufacturing. Seventy percent of respondents selected keeping tariffs low on intermediate inputs and raw materials, particularly those that cannot be sourced in the US.
 
This quarter’s survey, conducted from February 19 through March 7, 2025, was completed by 150 CEOs. More than three-quarters of responses were submitted before the 25% US tariffs on Canada and Mexico were announced on March 3, 2025. Odds are that the Q2 survey will show a big drop in the CEO index, which could weigh on capital spending.
 
**(2) Small business owners. **
The Uncertainty Index, compiled by the National Federation of Independent Business from a monthly survey of small business owners, was 104 in February, the second highest on record.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/11ab1780-114455.png)

The highest was 110 during October 2024.
 
**(3) Consumers. **
Also losing their confidence in Trump 2.0 are consumers. Debbie and I track the Consumer Optimism Index (COI), which is the average of the Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) and the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI). It fell to 75.4 during March, which is the lowest since July 2022.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Consumer Confidence](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/3/us-consumption-relative/22/consumer-confidence)*

In March 2017, during Trump 1.0, the COI was 111.3. Leading the way down has been the COI expectations component at 58.9 in March, the lowest since July 2022.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Consumer Confidence](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/3/us-consumption-relative/22/consumer-confidence)*
 
According to the CSI survey, consumers are depressed because their inflationary expectations soared in March to 5.0% over the next 12 months, up from 3.3% in January.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - UMich Inflation Expectations](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/5/us-price-relative/22021/mit-expected-inflation-rate)*

Their five-years-ahead inflationary expectations also jumped, to 4.1% in March from 3.2% in January. According to the CCI survey, more consumers are expecting fewer jobs will be available in six months.

**(5) Credit investors. **
The yield spread between the high-yield corporate bond composite and the 10-year Treasury bond yield has risen from a recent low of 239bps on January 24 to 320bps on Thursday.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [S&P 500 Volatility Index (VIX)](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4536/volatility/47/vix)*

That’s still a relatively narrow spread. Starting to show more signs of stress is the Invesco Senior Loan ETF (BKLN). It is down 1.7% so far this year.

**(6) US stock investors. **
On Saturday, March 22, President Trump said that he would be “flexible” on reciprocal tariffs. The S&P 500, which had fallen to a 2025 low of 5521.52 on March 13 (a 10.6% correction), peaked at 5776.65 on March 25.

At Friday’s close, it was back down to 5580.94 as investors realized that Trump was actually turning less flexible on tariffs. Indeed, on Monday, March 24, Trump threatened that countries that purchased oil and gas from Venezuela would face a 25% tariff on trade with the US. The S&P 500 is now down 9.2% from its record high on February 19. The Nasdaq is back in correction territory, with a 14.1% decline.

To be fair, the stock market’s woes aren’t all attributable to Trump 2.0. Investors have been questioning the sustainability and credibility of the AI story, with more concerns that it might be a bubble that is starting to burst. The Magnificent-7 have been at the forefront of this story. The Roundhill Magnificent-7 ETF (MAGS) is down 15.4% so far this year, while the Defiance Large Cap ex-Mag 7 ETF (XMAG) is down only 0.6% over this same period.

**(7) Global stock investors. **
Even overseas stock markets are weakening as investors realize that Trump’s tariffs are bad news not only for the US economy but for plenty of other economies around the world. Indeed, many economies might be more vulnerable to the tariffs than the US if their exports to the US are greater than are their imports from the US. Trade is more important to many economies than it is to the US economy.
 
The outperformance of overseas stock markets relative to the US stock market, which started at the beginning of this year, might be over already, as the ratio of the US MSCI stock price index to the All Country World ex-US MSCI stock price index appears to be bouncing off its long-term uptrend line. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/4240b720-180926.png)

In addition, the China AI rally also seems to be over. The Invesco China Technology ETF (CQQQ) has declined 11.1% since it peaked this year on March 17.

#### Reign of Tariffs II: Stagflationary Consequences.  
Along with CEOs, CFOs, small business owners, consumers, and investors, we are losing our confidence in Trump 2.0. Trump’s Reign of Tariffs is tariff-y-ing:
 
(1) In a March 18 Fox Business Network [interview](https://www.mediaite.com/tv/foxs-maria-bartiromo-presses-trump-treasury-secretary-on-trade-war-were-not-sure-where-this-is-going/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8iV5PPHryIERrTWJ3GAuEBrcWy90ND6miVNJXXNnw4QAhsTR-FfkwnpAzYhm5SRkX_0gLcFy6w_6_rKgcM7Yuf8iiFbQ&_hsmi=2), Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, “We are going to go to them [our trading partners] and say, ‘Look, here is where we think the tariff levels are, nontariff barriers, currency manipulation, unfair funding, labor suppression, and if you will stop this, we will not put up the tariff wall.’” If a country doesn’t change those policies, he continued, “then we will put up the tariff wall to protect our economy, protect our workers, and protect our industries.” That sounds like a reasonable way to force other countries to lower their trade barriers.
 
(2) Trump’s “flexible” [comment](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/21/trump-says-therell-be-flexibility-on-reciprocal-tariffs.html?msockid=2950f4fba8a160903b09e147a90c611c&utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8iV5PPHryIERrTWJ3GAuEBrcWy90ND6miVNJXXNnw4QAhsTR-FfkwnpAzYhm5SRkX_0gLcFy6w_6_rKgcM7Yuf8iiFbQ&_hsmi=2) a few days ago reflected his realization that estimating the impact of nontrade barriers was an impossible feat. So the reciprocal tariffs that he will be announced on April 2 will be based on estimates of average tariffs imposed by each trading partner with a trade deficit with the US.
 
In his Fox interview, Bessent said, “I’m optimistic that, April 2, some of the tariffs may not have to go on because a deal is pre-negotiated,” he added, “or that once countries receive their reciprocal tariff number, that, right after that, they will come to us and want to negotiate it down.”
 
(3) However, some tariffs will be permanent, according to Trump. On March 12, he imposed 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum coming into the US; on March 26, he announced 25% tariffs on all motor vehicles and parts imported into the US. These will be even more prohibitive if they are stacked on top of the average reciprocal tariffs.
 
The permanent tariffs on autos and parts, along with the permanent tariffs on aluminum and steel and possibly copper, are already boosting the prices of the metals and may soon increase both new and used car prices.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/9d6c895c-173582.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [NYMEX - Copper Futures Price](https://en.macromicro.me/series/1081/copper)*

Would-be auto buyers might respond to higher prices by continuing to drive their current vehicles. If so, then the auto industry will be hit with stagflation.
 
Initially, auto sales might boom in the next month or two as buyers scramble to buy autos before prices are raised to reflect the higher costs of producing a car in the US. Meanwhile, Trump warned automakers on Thursday not to raise their prices; yet not doing so would kill their profit margins. On Saturday, Trump told NBC News in an interview that he “couldn’t care less” if automakers raised prices.
 
For now, dealers have stockpiled a two- to three-month supply of new cars, so the impact of the tariffs might not start to be felt until June. At that point, vehicle prices could rise by more than 10% to offset the tariffs. That would push up auto insurance fees and the costs of maintenance and repair.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Consumer Price Index (CPI) - Used Cars and Trucks](https://en.macromicro.me/series/1030/us-used-auto-cpi)*
 
(4) The collective impact of all these tariffs is increasingly likely to be stagflationary. The tariffs will be paid either by foreign exporters to the US, US importers, and/or US consumers. The result will be higher prices and narrower profit margins than otherwise.
 
Economists generally agree that tariffs are a tax on imported goods that are normally paid by the importing company, which in turn passes on some or most of the cost of the tariffs to consumers in the form of higher prices.
 
#### Reign of Tariffs III: Stagflationary Readings. 
It’s really a shame that Trump is so willing to take a wrecking ball to the economy. It has been very resilient over the past three years in the face of the tightening of monetary policy. We are losing our confidence that it can remain resilient in the face of Trump’s Reign of Tariffs. The latest batch of data suggests that stagflation is already eroding the stellar performance of the economy, which hasn’t been in a recession since the pandemic lockdown in early 2020:
 
**(1) Personal income, consumption, and saving. **
Colder-than-normal weather during January and February undoubtedly depressed consumer spending those two months. Industrial production of utilities rose to record highs in both months.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/ff799779-196170.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Industrial Production Index](https://en.macromicro.me/series/349/industrial-production)*

The Atlanta Fed’s [GDPNow](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8iV5PPHryIERrTWJ3GAuEBrcWy90ND6miVNJXXNnw4QAhsTR-FfkwnpAzYhm5SRkX_0gLcFy6w_6_rKgcM7Yuf8iiFbQ&_hsmi=2) tracking model is showing that real consumer spending rose only 0.3% (saar) during Q1. We expect to see strong rebounds in March and April consumer spending as the weather improves and consumers scramble to buy autos and other goods before their prices go higher. That could set up the economy to be quite weak during Q3 and Q4 if consumers retrench when they are hit by higher prices attributable to Trump’s tariffs. Capital spending is also likely to get hit during the second half of this year.
 
For now, the labor market remains strong, as reflected by low initial unemployment claims. February’s real personal income rose 0.4% m/m, and the nominal personal saving rate increased from 3.3% in December to 4.6% in February because the cold weather held down consumer spending.
 
**(2) PCED inflation. **
We no longer expect that the PCED inflation rate will range between 2.0%-3.0%, as it has since early 2024. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/15cb17f1-185449.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCE)](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/5/us-price-relative/25/pce-price)*

Instead, we expect to see it range between 3.0%-4.0% over the rest of this year before it settles back down to 2.0%-3.0% next year, maybe. The PCED services inflation rate should continue to moderate.

However, the PCED goods inflation rate is likely to rise faster along with tariffs in coming months.

**(3) Regional business surveys. **
The ISM manufacturing PMI was showing signs of recovering during January and February.

The same can be said about the regional business surveys conducted by five of the 12 Federal Reserve district banks. However, the regional surveys suggest that the manufacturing recovery faltered in March in reaction to Trump Tariff Turmoil 2.0.
 
Just as disturbing is that the regional prices-paid and prices-received indexes jumped higher since the start of the year through March.

The surveys suggest that stagflation is seeping into the economy. The obvious source of the problem is Trump’s tariffs.
 
#### Reign of Tariffs IV: Recalibrating Our Forecasts Again. 
We’ve alerted you before that we might have to change our minds more often because Trump changes his mind so often. Here we go:
 
**(1) Raising stagflation odds.**
We are reducing the subjective odds of our optimistic Roaring 2020s scenario from 65% to 55% and raising the odds of a pessimistic stagflation scenario from 35% to 45%. The former worked out great for us during the first half of the current decade. We still expect it to prevail over the remainder of the decade. But Trump’s Reign of Tariffs is likely to get in its way this year. The stagflation scenario includes the possibility of a shallow recession during the second half of this year. The higher inflation part of stagflation is almost a certainty.
 
**(2) Real GDP.** 
We had been expecting 2.5%-3.0% real GDP growth this year, similar to the pace of the past year.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/7add6ba8-215247.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Real GDP](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/2/us-gdp-relative/12/real-gdp-growth)*

We are lowering that to 1.5%. Here are our forecasts for the four quarters of 2025: Q1 (1.0%), Q2 (3.5%), Q3 (0.5%), and Q4 (1.0%). The last two quarters could have negative signs. The surge in Q2’s real GDP reflects a buy-in-advance rush by consumers during April and May before tariffs jack up prices in June.
 
**(3) Inflation.** 
As discussed above, we are raising our PCED inflation forecast range to between 3.0%-4.0% over the rest of this year and then lowering it back down to 2.0%-3.0% in 2026. That assumes that there won’t be a trade war with tit-for-tariff retaliation. If there is, there will be a recession that will bring inflation down.
 
**(4) Interest rates.** 
We’ve been predicting none-and-done for Fed rate-cutting this year because of better-than-expected GDP growth. Now we are predicting that the Fed won’t be able to ease even if the economy stagnates because higher inflation will force the Fed to stay put. The Fed Put will remain on hold. As a result, we aren’t changing our forecast for the 10-year Treasury bond yield to remain in the 4.25%-4.75% range this year.
 
**(5) Stock market.** 
We’ve previously written that we couldn’t rule out a bear market under the circumstances, which have continued to deteriorate under Trump’s Reign of Tariffs. Our increased stagflation odds—to 45%—is also the odds that the current stock market correction will turn into a full-blown bear market. In other words, if we have stagflation in the economy, we can expect to have a bear market in stocks.
 
So we are lowering our S&P 500 year-end target (again) from 6400 to 6100, which would be up 4% from the end of last year. In this scenario, the current correction could turn into a bear market in coming months before turning into a bull market again later this year on expectations of a resumption of the Roaring 2020s in 2026 and beyond. In addition, later this year, investors might begin to anticipate that the Fed will start lowering interest rates early in 2026 to clean up the mess from Trump’s Reign of Tariffs.
 
**(6) Politics. **
The Stock Market Vigilantes are also losing their confidence in Trump 2.0. The risk is that they cause a bear market, resulting in a consumer-led recession as the negative wealth effect depresses consumer spending (especially by retiring Baby Boomers). This time, the Fed won’t come to the rescue so quickly if inflation is heading higher again. We are hoping that the Republicans will realize that the odds are increasing that they will lose their majorities in both houses of Congress if the White House continues to pursue stagflationary trade policies.
 
**(7) Personal note. **
Admittedly, it’s getting harder to be optimistic, but we are doing the best we can under the circumstances.

"1121","CEO House View | A Month of Market Divergence: What’s Trump’s Endgame? ","ceo-house-view-a-month-of-market-divergence-what-s-trump-s-endgame","2025-04-01","Dear all, 

Global equity markets saw a marked divergence in March, with markets trading at high P/E ratios such as [U.S.](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/34/us-stock-relative) and [Taiwanese](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/6502/mm-fundamental-index/725/tw-mm-twse) stocks seeing pullbacks, while [European equities](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/181/msci-eur-index/2108/mm-eur-index) and Hong Kong’s [Hang Seng Index](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/1658/hk-stock-relative/13737/hk-hsi-volatility-index-vs-hsi) posted robust gains, emerging as key destinations for capital inflows. 

Meanwhile, currency and bond markets also reflected the trend of capital reallocation, with the [U.S. Dollar Index](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/1767/us-dollar/14948/mm-dxy-expectation-index) retreating from its year-to-date highs and the [10-year Treasury yield](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/51/us-treasury-bond/761/us-10year-treasury-bond) also experiencing a decline. Notably, [gold prices](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/45/mm-gold-price) continued to hit new highs throughout the month, reflecting ongoing hedging demand against potential economic slowdown and policy uncertainty, as well as how the market is pricing in potential deglobalization risks, especially as Trump’s policies continue to dominate market sentiment. 

 

These developments call for a reassessment of several key questions: **How is Trump’s current policy agenda different from his previous term? Is he intentionally engineering a recession? Why has recession talk centered on the U.S. rather than the global economy? Or could the volatility simply be part of a healthy market rotation? ** 

  

Below are my observations and analysis based on the latest economic and policy developments. 

 

--- 

 

#### 1. Key Evolution of Trump's Policy Agenda: From Short-Term Stimulus to Long-Term Structural Overhaul 

A closer look at Trump’s recent statements and actions suggests a major shift in his second-term policy focus—**significantly greater emphasis on the long-term structure of the U.S. economy**. During his first term, Trump prioritized rapid economic stimulus, including large-scale tax cuts (through the TCJA), increased government spending, and deregulation, which successfully fueled short-term economic momentum but also rapidly widened the fiscal deficit, raising concerns over the sustainability of U.S. national debt for long-term investors. 

 

In this term, we see a clear shift in policy direction—**policy measures are no longer solely focused on short-term market performance, but on addressing three critical long-term structural issues facing the U.S. economy**: 
1. **Over-reliance on foreign capital with dollar-denominated assets fueled by persistent current account deficit;**
2. **Fiscal deficit and national debt that continue to balloon in a post-ultra-low interest rate environment; and**
3. **The accelerating trend of global de-dollarization.** 

Trump's seemingly erratic policies are fundamentally a structural response, **aimed at restoring U.S. economic sovereignty to some extent while maintaining the dollar’s standing**. Measures such as continued tariff tactics aimed at China and revitalizing American manufacturing, stricter fiscal discipline to restore confidence in U.S. Treasuries, and even proposals on a sovereign wealth fund, taxes on capital inflows, and immigration “gold cards” are all geared towards attracting capital back to the U.S. and stimulating investment, with the goal of rebuilding the long-term resilience of the U.S. economy. 

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/17c4537d-1046668.png)

The shift is also evident in the President’s rhetoric and approach. **Unlike his first term, where policies immediately fueled market excitement (dealing out tax cuts but also increasing spending), this time, Trump is not rushing to appease investors, but instead emphasizes on the importance of “rebuilding the nation.”** In a recent Fox News interview, he noted that the U.S. economy would see “a period of transition”, and in a statement at the White House on March 12, he also commented that, “Markets are going to go up and they’re going to go down. We have to rebuild our country.” 

 

While this rhetoric shift will inevitably introduce short-term volatility, I believe it’s a beneficial step toward improving the structural health of the U.S. economy in the long run.

#### 2. Soft Data vs. Hard Data: Confidence Slips, But Fundamentals Remain Strong 

Of course, these shifts have also led to a noticeable divergence in the economic data since the new policies took effect, **with the soft data (surveys and expectations) showing weakness while the hard data (actual economic activity) remains robust.** 

 

On the soft data front, the [UMich Consumer Sentiment Index](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/3/us-consumption-relative/22/consumer-confidence) fell to 57.9 (prev. 64.7), the [UMich long-term inflation expectations](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/5/us-price-relative/22021/mit-expected-inflation-rate) surged to a near 20-year high, and overall sentiment per the BofA Global Fund Manager Survey dropped sharply from 6.4 in February to 3.8, marking a seven-month low. These figures reflect heightened market vigilance over shifting policies, inflation risks, and trade-related uncertainty. In contrast, the hard data continued to reflect solid expansion: [Nonfarm payrolls](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4/us-employ-relative) reached150,000 in February, with the government sector still [adding 11,000 jobs](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4/us-employ-relative/110016/us-nonfarm-payrolls-by-sector-monthly-change-stacked-chart) despite the DOGE layoffs. [Disposable personal income](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/3/us-consumption-relative/88/real-disposable-personal-income) hit a record high, and the momentum in household spending remained intact. Manufacturing and service sector activity also held steady, showing no signs of significant cooling in the economy. 

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/bd489180-693180.png)

These data points underscore the continued resilience of U.S. domestic demand and labor market. While there’s market speculation that Trump is deliberately engineering a recession to lower the performance benchmarks for his tenure, let’s not forget that in two years, the GOP’s slim majority in both chambers of Congress will be put to the test in the midterm elections. Assessing Trump’s policy moves since February, the administration seems to be balancing the trade-off between long-term structural improvements and short-term economic stability, opting for controlled growth and deficit reduction, thereby guiding the economy into a period of moderate expansion (GDP growth projected at 1.5~2%). Such an environment would support the Fed to proceed with the rate-cutting cycle (Trump likes low interest rates), alleviating the strain of high debt-servicing costs and even stabilizing the ongoing capital outflows in both the bond market and broader capital markets. 

 

--- 

 

#### 3. Tariffs: A Real Trade War or Just Negotiating Tactics? 

Another major focus this month has been Trump's continued push for global tariffs. Are these tariffs for real, or just a strategic maneuver? My assessment is that it’s a mix of both. While tariff revenues can partially offset forthcoming fiscal stimulus spending, this remains a secondary benefit. As previously highlighted, we can see that Trump is using pressure tactics to force talks, rather than launching a full-scale economic war. Examples include TSMC’s bolstered investment in the U.S. to secure tariff exemptions, India’s commitment to finalize a bilateral trade agreement with the U.S., and active discussions on investing in the U.S. by the UK and Japan, offering them chances of avoiding tariffs. So far, the actual enforcement of tariffs has been limited to China (20% tariff on all imports) and specific industries (25% tariff on steel and aluminum). Regarding the reciprocal tariffs slated for April 2 and the 25% auto tariffs about to take effect, we expect substantial room for negotiation for the former, while the latter will likely focus on regional negotiations with Europe, Canada & Mexico, and Southeast Asia. Since automobiles are a major contributor to the U.S. trade deficit, auto tariffs offer a tangible source of tax revenue (great for domestic optics) and could also help with deterring China from circumventing restrictions, limiting deepening China-Europe ties, and incentivizing manufacturing reshoring to the U.S.

### Market Outlook and Allocation Strategy: Healthy Rotation Beneath the Turbulence 

If Trump's policies were indeed the catalyst for market turmoil, why have China and Europe, arguably the regions most likely to be impacted, been leading the gains instead? This suggests that the current market dynamics are more indicative of a valuation correction and capital reallocation, rather than a systemic risk event triggered by deteriorating fundamentals.  

 

In this context, asset allocation strategies should move beyond panic-driven adjustments, and instead focus on a more stratified approach based on capital size and investment horizon. **For short-term investors, diversifying to undervalued segments may enhance returns. Bur for medium-to-long-term investments, consider capitalizing on pullbacks to gradually accumulate positions in segments with long-term structural advantages, at the same time, maintaining a balanced three-pronged approach across equities, bonds (investment-grade over government debt), and gold for strategic hedging and evolving asset demand against deglobalization risks.** 

 

This brief analysis provides a glimpse into our research team’s view on the Trump administration’s latest policy direction. Of course, there’s plenty more to discuss, but keeping things short here given space limitations. For deeper insights, we have launched the [Trump Watch](https://en.macromicro.me/potus-47-donald-trump), where we will continue to update the most relevant data and insights. Also, don’t miss out on **our latest [MEO Global Economic Outlook](https://en.macromicro.me/video) (free for annual subscribers!)**, where we delve into two critical themes: the impending shift in global order and the four major opportunities driven by Trump and AI. 

 

Lastly, I’d also like to share the exciting news that we’ll be launching the U.S. Earnings Database section next month, alongside a major announcement. So stay tuned for more details!

As April 2nd, ""Liberation Day,"" approaches, global markets remain on edge. A wave of uncertainty triggered by President Trump's upcoming tariff announcements has already caused a noticeable decline in stock prices, with the S&P 500 and major international indices falling. 

Meanwhile, gold prices have surged to new highs as investors seek safety amid the volatility. With the global economy bracing for potential shifts in trade policies, now is the time to understand the far-reaching implications for markets, commodities, and your investment strategy. 

Read on in this week's [Weekly Economic and Financial Commentary (WEFC)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ci94UYgLvkBO5jPB8LONHHbUl_LRmM5g/view) to gain insights into what’s unfolding and how you can navigate these turbulent times.








[![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1118/3731dec7-653558.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ci94UYgLvkBO5jPB8LONHHbUl_LRmM5g/view)



#### Stock Market Decline & Gold Surge: 

Global stock markets fell last week, especially after Trump’s auto tariff announcement. The S&P 500 dropped by 1.58%, and major markets like Japan, Europe, and South Korea saw declines of 1-4%. Meanwhile, gold prices surged to new highs as a safe-haven asset.

#### Impact of US Tariffs: 

The US plans to impose a 25% tariff on non-U.S. made cars starting April 3, with similar tariffs on auto parts from May 3. This move is expected to impact Mexico and Canada the most, with Mexico’s economy particularly vulnerable due to its automotive sector reliance on the US.

#### Unpacking Trump’s “Fight-to-Talk” Strategy: 

Trump’s approach has shifted from short-term economic boosts to focusing on structural changes, targeting the US trade deficit and national debt. His strategy aims for long-term stability rather than immediate market wins.

#### Gold and Copper Prices Surge: 

Gold has seen record inflows, partly driven by rising tariffs and geopolitical risks. Similarly, copper prices have surged due to tariff concerns, creating a historic gap between US and global prices.

#### US Economic Resilience Amid Uncertainty: 

Despite some negative economic signals like the Atlanta Fed’s GDP forecast, the US economy shows resilience through steady employment and retail sales. Inflation concerns are still present but have moderated.

#### Key Economic Events Ahead: 

Significant economic events to watch include Trump’s ""Liberation Day"" announcement on April 2, which could lead to reciprocal tariffs, and the upcoming March US jobs report on April 4, expected to show a slowdown in job growth.

"1112","Yardeni Research | The Fed’s Economic Forecast Versus The Consensus & Ours","yardeni-research-the-fed-s-economic-forecast-versus-the-consensus-ours","2025-03-26","#### Executive Summary: 
Investors clearly fear a recession is coming—that’s what the recent stock market correction suggests. The consensus of economists probably puts the prospect of a recession at 35% (as we now do). Fed officials likely expect to avert a recession by lowering interest rates; FOMC meeting participants dropped their GDP projections last week to 1.7% this year. As for us, we see a fork in the road. One way leads to stagflation, which includes the possibility of a recession (35% odds). But our base case remains the Roaring 2020s (65%), in which a tech-led productivity boom lifts profit margins, propels GDP, suppresses inflation, and fuels wage growth and consumers’ buying power. … Check out the accompanying [chart collection](https://yardeni.com/wp-content/uploads/cc_20250324.pdf).

#### Forecasts I: The Consensus. 
Trump Turmoil 2.0 has caused a correction in the stock market. The S&P 500 fell 10.1% from its record high on February 19 through March 13.

It was down 7.8% on Friday from its peak. The Nasdaq is down 11.8% from its peak on December 16 through Friday’s close.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - NASDAQ Composite](https://en.macromicro.me/series/32/nasdaq-composite)*

The Magnificent-7 stocks led the recent rout. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is down 18.8% from its record high on December 17, while the Defiance Large Cap ex-Mag 7 ETF is down 6.0% since February 19.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/3e77fe0f-141591.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Magnificent Seven Total Market Cap and Share of S&P 500](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4093/us-big-tech/123469/us-magnificent-seven-total-market-cap-and-share-of-sp-500)*

The latter is essentially the S&P 500 minus the Mag-7, i.e., the “S&P 493.”
 
As we’ve previously noted, S&P 500 corrections (10%-20% declines) typically occur when investors fear a recession is imminent. The decline is attributable to a drop in the forward P/E of the S&P 500. The forward earnings of the index continues to rise because industry analysts tend not to share the recession concerns of investors. That’s because such fears don’t plug well into the analysts’ earnings models; the analysts are more attuned to what managements are saying about the companies they cover. Bear markets (declines of 20% or more) occur when investors’ recession fears are realized, forcing industry analysts to scramble to cut their earnings estimates.
 
So the forward P/E is a leading indicator of the economy that isn’t very accurate, while forward earnings is highly correlated with the Index of Coincident Economic Indicators, which is the most accurate monthly indicator of the business cycle.

Currently, investors fear a recession, while forward earnings continues to rise to record-high territory. On March 5, Debbie, Eric, and I raised our subjective probability of a recession from 20% to 35% because of the Trump administration’s increasing tariff turmoil and shotgun approach to reducing federal government payrolls.
 
Polymarket.com, an online betting platform, showed that the odds of a recession stood at 22% in mid-February.

It rose to about 40% during the first half of March and is now at 35%. Polymarket also allows traders to place a bet on “How high will inflation get in 2025?” However, the choices are limited to inflation rising above 3%, above 4%, and up to “above 10%.” The latest betting shows 48% odds on inflation rising above 3%.
 
Meanwhile, the March Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) survey showed that respondents expect a median inflation rate of 4.9% over the next 12 months, while a similar February survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed 3.1% over the same period.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/4d98b48e-200881.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - UMich Inflation Expectations](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/5/us-price-relative/22021/mit-expected-inflation-rate)*
 
It’s hard to pin down a precise consensus outlook for inflation. The same can be said about an outlook for the economy. That’s partly because consensus forecasts change over time. Also, the consensus of the general public is bound to be different than that of economists, which is bound to differ from investors’ consensus. Different strokes for different folks, depending on their personal experiences and biases. Indeed, the CSI survey has become very partisan lately, with Democrats much more pessimistic than Republicans about the outlook for inflation and the economy.
 
The Wall Street Journal conducts a quarterly survey of economists. The latest survey was covered in a January 19 [article](https://www.wsj.com/economy/economist-survey-inflation-2025-1fd00467?mod=article_inline&utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8yf0eAJyd3cxAuk7g-htfzk42UA0eq37e7Dkr_JjBk8ew1_U76FSUs8qfXCFEkVvBbCTCm3GEjZI2LeLEow8vZHZKowg&_hsmi=2). Here are the salient points:
 
**(1) GDP & recession odds.** 
The odds of a recession over the next 12 months in the January poll was down to 22%, the lowest since January 2022 and down from the most recent peak of 63% during October 2022. The economists collectively forecast that real GDP will increase 2.0% in 2025.
 
If we may be allowed to forecast the forecasters, we reckon that the survey in early April will show that their subjective odds of a recession has increased to 35%, the same as ours. We guess that their 2.0% real GDP forecast for this year will remain unchanged. Ours remains unchanged at 2.5%-3.0%.
 
**(2) Inflation.** 
Economists had already begun modeling the effects of President Trump’s plans to raise tariffs, cut taxes, and restrict immigration at the time of the article: “The upshot: Inflation and interest rates are likely to be higher for at least the next two years than forecasters anticipated before the election.”
 
The consensus of 73 economists showed the CPI inflation rate at 2.7% y/y through December 2025, up from 2.3% in the October survey. Their forecast for inflation this year is likely to be closer to 3.0% in the April survey on concerns that Trump’s tariffs are bound to boost prices at least on a one-shot basis. In late November, Trump said he would impose tariffs of 25% on Mexico and Canada and 10% on China on day one of his presidency. He started talking about more widespread “reciprocal tariffs” about a month ago. They are scheduled to be announced on April 2, which is likely to influence the next WSJ survey results.
 
**(3) Interest rates.** 
Here is what the WSJ article reported about the consensus outlook for interest rates: “Faced with stickier inflation, economists expect the Fed to keep interest rates higher through 2027 than previously forecast. The midpoint of the range of the federal funds rate [FFR], currently 4.375%, is now seen ending the year at 3.89%, up from the October average projection of 3.3%. Economists now expect the 10-year Treasury bond yield to end 2025 at 4.4%, up from an October projection of 3.7%.”
 
We reckon the consensus FFR forecast will remain about the same, calling for two 25bps cuts this year. The year-end bond yield forecast might drop a bit from the WSJ survey’s 4.4% to the current level of 4.2%.
 
We are still in the none-and-done camp on Fed rate cutting this year. If we are wrong, the current consensus of economists and the FFR futures market—two rate cuts—will likely be right. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/6cdf7678-176049.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Federal Funds Rate vs. S&P 500](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/9/us-market-relative/91/interest-rate-sp500)*

We still expect the 10-year Treasury bond yield to range mostly between 4.25% and 4.75% this year.
 
#### Forecasts II: The Fed. 
The latest [Summary of Economic Projections](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20250319.pdf?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8yf0eAJyd3cxAuk7g-htfzk42UA0eq37e7Dkr_JjBk8ew1_U76FSUs8qfXCFEkVvBbCTCm3GEjZI2LeLEow8vZHZKowg&_hsmi=2) (SEP), released by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) after its meeting last Wednesday, showed that the meeting participants collectively expect to lower the FFR from 4.25%-4.50% currently. In terms of their new economic forecasts, their “dot plot” continues to have two 25bps cuts this year, two next year, and one in 2027, with the “longer-run” FFR still seen at 3%.

The latter implies that the current level of the FFR is restrictive.
 
Presumably, most FOMC participants are anticipating that they will have to lower the FFR closer to its longer-run level to avert a recession. Indeed, they lowered their real GDP growth forecasts to 1.7% from 2.1% for 2025, to 1.8% from 2.0% for 2026, and to 1.8% from 1.9% for 2027.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/e108b717-738603.png)
This likely reflects the growth drags from government spending cuts and the prospect of significant tariffs squeezing profit margins and household spending power.
 
That’s a relatively pessimistic forecast considering that the labor force is growing between 0.5% and 1.0% y/y currently and productivity is growing around 2.0% y/y.

Those numbers add up to real GDP growth rates of 2.5%-3.0% y/y, consistent with our more upbeat outlook.

In the SEP, the median unemployment rate projection for the end of this year was raised from 4.3% to 4.4%.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/6f4f57c3-732367.png)
It remained at 4.3% for the ends of both 2026 and 2027.
 
So why are Fed officials saying that they are in no hurry to lower interest rates if they are anticipating they will have to do so to avert a recession later this year? Indeed, just a few hours after the FOMC voted to leave the FFR unchanged, in a post Wednesday night on Truth Social, President Trump encouraged Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues to ease policy as the administration enters the next phase of its aggressive trade policy.
 
“The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S.Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy,” Trump wrote. “Do the right thing. April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!”
 
The Fed is in no hurry to do so because the latest economic indicators suggest that the economy remains resilient. Furthermore, Fed officials have raised their inflation expectations since the December SEP, with core PCED now expected to end the year at 2.8% versus 2.5% in December, presumably reflecting upside pressure on prices from tariffs, but their 2026 forecast remains 2.2%.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/f135a84a-638098.png)
In other words, the FOMC expects tariffs to have a transitory impact on inflation.
 
In his [press conference](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20250319.pdf?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8yf0eAJyd3cxAuk7g-htfzk42UA0eq37e7Dkr_JjBk8ew1_U76FSUs8qfXCFEkVvBbCTCm3GEjZI2LeLEow8vZHZKowg&_hsmi=2) on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell confirmed all the above:
 
**(1) Transitory uncertainty.**
Powell mentioned the words “uncertain” or “uncertainty” 16 times. He attributed the abnormal amount of uncertainty to Trump 2.0. For example, he said, “So in the current situation, there’s probably some elevated uncertainty because of … significant policy shifts in those four areas that I mentioned: tariffs, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulatory policy. So there’s probably some additional uncertainty, but that should be passing; we should go through that. And then we’ll be back to the regular amount of uncertainty.”
 
**(2) Tariffs are the known unknown. **
The main source of uncertainty is clearly tariffs, according to Powell: “We don’t know what’s going to be tariffed. We don’t know for how long or how much [or] what countries. We don’t know about retaliation. We don’t know how it’s going to transmit through the economy to consumers. That really does remain to be seen. [T]here are lots of places where … that price increase from the tariff can show up between the manufacturer and a consumer. Just so many variables. So we’re just going to have to wait and see.”
 
**(3) Inflation closer to target. **
Powell noted that inflation has moderated significantly over the past two years. He acknowledged that it “remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal.” He also said, “Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.6% over the 12 months ending in December and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8%.” He did not mention the recent spike in the CSI survey’s one-year-ahead expected inflation rate. Instead, he said that long-term inflation expectations “remain well anchored.”
 
It's not clear why Powell estimated December’s PCED inflation rates. January’s numbers came out at the end of last month showing headline and core inflation rates of 2.5% and 2.6%.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCE)](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/5/us-price-relative/25/pce-price)*

He might have misspoken and was actually referring to February’s PCED, which will be released on March 28.
 
February’s headline and core CPI inflation rates were 2.8% and 3.1%.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Consumer Price Index (CPI) - Core Goods](https://en.macromicro.me/series/7914/consumer-price-index-sa-core-goods)*

More encouraging were the 2.0% and 2.2% readings excluding shelter.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/9419f26a-238570.png)

The CPI rent of shelter inflation rate remains elevated at 4.3% y/y, but it remains on a moderating trend.

**(4) Transitory tariff inflation. **
Powell mentioned the word “transitory” twice when he discussed the likely impact of tariffs on inflation. For example: “As I’ve mentioned, it can be the case that it’s appropriate sometimes to look through inflation if it’s going to go away quickly without action by us, if it’s transitory. And that can be the case [with] tariff inflation. I think that would depend on the tariff inflation moving through fairly quickly and critically as well [as] on longer-term inflation expectations being well anchored.”
 
Describing inflation as “transitory” didn’t work out so well for Powell last time, in 2021, just before inflation turned into a persistent problem during 2022 and 2023. Powell noted that Trump 1.0’s tariffs didn’t move the needle on inflation. But he didn’t mention that the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of June 1930 had an extremely deflationary impact, causing the global economy to fall into a depression.
 
**(5) Good place. **
On balance, Powell came across as relatively optimistic: “And right now, we feel like we’re in a very good place. Policy’s well positioned. The economy’s in … quite a good place …[W] hat we do expect is to see further progress on inflation, and …as we see that—or if we were to see weakening in the labor market that could foster—we could then be in a position … of making further adjustments. But right now … we don’t see that, and we see things as in a really good place for policy and for the economy. … [S]o we feel like we don’t need to be in a hurry …to make any adjustments.”
 
Powell did not respond to Trump’s post Wednesday evening.
 
#### Forecasts III: Our Two Scenarios. 
We’ve decided to fold our 1990s meltup/meltdown scenario into our Roaring 2020s scenario. The current correction in the stock market suggests that the former has played out already, as the bull market’s highflyers have been hit hardest by the current correction. That leaves us with two scenarios: the Roaring 2020s, to which we assign a 65% subjective probability, and a mostly stagflation scenario, with a 35% probability. The former includes the possibility of a rebound in the former highflyers, while the latter includes the possibility of a recession.
 
So our base case continues to be more upbeat than both the consensus expectations of economists and the projections of Fed officials. In this Roaring 2020s scenario, productivity growth continues to be boosted by technological innovations. That boosts the growth rate of real GDP, keeps a lid on inflation, fuels the growth of real wages (i.e., consumers’ purchasing power), and lifts profit margins.

Global equities found their footing this week as investors pivoted into cyclical stocks, keeping the S&P 500 comfortably above 5,600. Meanwhile, gold and copper surged to record highs, fueled by renewed concerns over metal tariffs.

On the policy front, the Federal Reserve held rates steady and slowed down quantitative tightening—a clear signal to support market liquidity. With two rate cuts on the horizon, stocks bounced back. **But is this a real rally… or just a temporary lift?**

This week’s [Weekly Economic and Financial Commentary (WEFC)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jfxtZfJUwGJCxDVbGGOsp3tpeZb7G60d/view?usp=sharing) cuts through the noise, unpacking what’s really driving markets—and what’s just short-term static.


[![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1115/f1f68a22-795413.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jfxtZfJUwGJCxDVbGGOsp3tpeZb7G60d/view?usp=sharing)

#### 1. Market Rotation Supports Global Equities; Gold and Copper Hit Record Highs
Global equities stabilized as investors rotated capital from China and Europe into cyclicals and underperforming markets. The S&P 500 held above 5,600, led by industrials and financials. Gold broke above $3,000/oz, and copper hit new highs amid tariff concerns.



#### 2. Corporate Earnings Face Pressure, but EPS Growth Remains Broadly Positive
Earnings revisions have trended lower for 13 weeks, led by U.S. companies—likely due to tariffs. Still, most sectors in the U.S., Europe, and Japan report positive EPS growth, showing solid fundamentals despite a more cautious global profit outlook.


#### 3. Fed Slows QT as Market Bets on More Rate Cuts
The Fed kept rates steady and slowed quantitative tightening, aiming to preserve market liquidity. It forecasts two cuts this year, but markets expect three. Inflation expectations rose, but Powell dismissed consumer survey data as an outlier. Tariffs are seen as a short-term inflation risk.

#### 4. Central Banks Hold Steady, But Global Policy Paths Diverge
The Fed, ECB, BoE, and BoJ held rates unchanged. However, outlooks are diverging: the Fed and BoC lean toward easing, while BoE and ECB are cautious. The BoJ may hike again as wage growth accelerates. Global rate differentials are driving FX and bond market shifts.

#### 5. U.S. Housing Market Remains Resilient Despite High Rates
Housing starts rebounded 11.2% in February. New home inventory is rising, but existing home supply remains tight. Mortgage rates stay elevated, yet loan demand is recovering.

"1108","Yardeni Research | The Bull Versus The Bear Case","yardeni-research-the-bull-versus-the-bear-case","2025-03-19","#### Executive Summary: 
Will all the Trump turmoil deepen the recent stock market correction into a bear market? Very few bear markets have occurred without accompanying recessions. If no recession looms, today’s historically stretched valuations could be sustained, Dr Ed says. But the Trump factor is unpredictable, and a trade war could cause a recession. Would Trump pivot before that point, pressured by the Stock Market Vigilantes? … Read on for Ed’s balanced assessment of both the bear and bull market cases. … And an unsettling question for the future: Might the “Roaring 2020s” give way to a repeat of the 1930s, “The New Global Disorder of the 2030s”? It’s all up to Trump. … Check out the accompanying [chart collection](https://yardeni.com/wp-content/uploads/cc_20250317.pdf).

#### Strategy I: The Valuation Problem. 
Last Thursday, I visited with some of our accounts in Connecticut. They seemed remarkably relaxed that day as the S&P 500 fell into correction territory. Many of them are seasoned institutional investors and have been through lots of corrections and bear markets. Everyone attributed the selloff to Trump Tariff Turmoil 2.0.
 
The bulls still believe (hope) that President Donald Trump is using tariffs as a bargaining tool to negotiate lower tariffs with America’s major trading partners. Some of them predict that if that’s not the case, then Trump will back off in response to political pressure to do so from lots of constituencies that stand to be harmed by a trade war. He might also back off if the stock market continues to tank. The bears warn that by the time Trump ever would relent, the economy would be in a consumer-led recession and the stock market surely would be in a bear market.
 
We remain bullish, but less so. On Wednesday, March 5, Eric, Debbie, and I raised the odds of a bearish scenario from 20% to 35%. That might entail an outright recession or a period of stagflation. On March 9, we wrote: We can’t rule out the possibility that a bear market started on February 20, the day after the S&P 500 rose to a record high. On March 13, we lowered our year-end 2025 S&P 500 target from 7000 to 6400.
 
We continue to bet on the resilience of the consumer, the economy, and corporate earnings, but we reckon that heightened recession fears will weigh on valuation multiples. We acknowledge that the risks of a recession and a bear market might continue to increase. It all depends on the often-unpredictable President, who frequently—and proudly—has referred to himself as “Tariff Man,” reflecting his strong support for protectionist trade policies.
 
We all know that the S&P 500 forward P/E and P/S are stretched by historical standards.

The latter, which is simply a weekly version of the Buffett Ratio, rose to a record high of 3.04 on December 4. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1108/a6157d40-193016.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Buffett Indicator](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/406/us-buffet-index-gspc)*

It was back down to 2.75 last week, which is still very high. The forward P/E ratio remained below its previous two cyclical highs because the rising forward profit margin boosted earnings relative to revenues. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1108/c132a74c-147343.png)

Nevertheless, the forward P/E was high at 20.2 last week, though down from a recent peak of 22.3 during the December 6 week.
 
We’ve argued that high valuation multiples might be sustainable if there is no recession in sight. Since the S&P 500 peaked at a record high on February 19, concerns about a recession caused by Trump's tariffs have been mounting, as we acknowledged by raising our subjective odds of a recession. Nevertheless, we didn’t change our optimistic outlook for forward earnings. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1108/18e182cf-155625.png)

But we did lower our range for the forward P/E from 18-22 to 18-20.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1108/a3a22f1a-221541.png)
 
The Nasdaq, which peaked at a record high on December 16, fell into correction territory (down 10%-20%) on March 6.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1108/4431509d-174950.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [NASDAQ Composite Index](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/550/stock-nasdaq)*

It is down 12.0% through Friday. The S&P 500 fell into correction territory last Thursday and was down 8.2% from its record peak on Friday.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1108/5c0372fb-195374.png)

Corrections occur when the stock market starts to discount a recession that doesn’t occur. It is almost always attributable to a drop in the forward P/E, while forward earnings continue to rise (or at least don’t fall). A bear market (down 20% or more) typically occurs when a recession happens, sending both the valuation multiple and earnings expectations tumbling. Only a few bear markets have occurred when no recession unfolded (i.e., in 1962, 1987, and 2022).
 
Now let’s turn to the case for a bear market followed by the case for a resumption of the bull market following the latest corrections in the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.
 
#### Strategy II: The Bear Case. 
The preliminary Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) survey for March supports the bear case in which consumers reduce their spending, causing a recession. At the same time, higher inflation prevents the Fed from lowering interest rates. The CSI during the first two weeks of March fell to 57.9, the lowest since November 2022. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1108/6d88b9fb-332135.png)
 ▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Consumer Confidence](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/3/us-consumption-relative/22/consumer-confidence)*
 
That’s close to the average trough readings of the CSI during the previous six recessions!

In the latest CSI survey, inflationary expectations over the next year and the next five years spiked up to 4.9% and 3.9%. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1108/8987c682-200142.png)

In the past, such spikes were usually associated with rapidly rising gasoline prices. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1108/2fa3fc05-231611.png)

This time, inflationary expectations have been inflamed by fears that tariffs will boost prices because they are akin to sales taxes.
 
Recently, several consumer-related companies have noted that consumer spending might be starting to flag. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said “budget-pressured” customers are showing “stressed behaviors,” like buying smaller pack sizes at the end of the month because their “money runs out before the month is gone.” Kohl’s and Dick’s Sporting Goods issued weaker-than-anticipated annual forecasts. Delta, American, and Southwest Airlines cut their Q1 estimates, warning of the impact of a weaker economic backdrop on travel demand.
 
Here are more arguments for the bear case:
 
**(1) Negative wealth effect. **
We’ve been observing that retiring Baby Boomers have accounted for much of the resilience of consumer spending, which was boosted by a very positive wealth effect for many as the value of their homes and stock portfolios appreciated. The risk now is that consumers will retrench because of the negative wealth effect attributable to falling stock prices. The Baby Boomers currently hold a record $25.0 trillion in corporate equities and mutual funds, or 54% of the total.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1108/ea13a8b9-94492.png)

Falling stock prices could have a significant negative wealth effect on the spending of retired Baby Boomers.
 
**(2) DOGE & employment. **
Elon Musk reduced Twitter’s workforce by approximately 80% after acquiring the company. The number of employees dropped from around 8,000 to about 1,500. He is now also in charge of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and has been taking a chainsaw to federal government payrolls, which totaled 3.0 civilian workers in January, before Trump 2.0 started to take effect. On Thursday, federal judges in California and Maryland ordered Trump’s administration to reinstate thousands of probationary federal workers who lost their jobs as part of mass firings carried out at 19 agencies.
 
Also at risk are jobs at contractors of the federal government. The General Accountability Office [reported](www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gao.gov/federal-contracting?utm_campaign%3DMorning%2520Briefing%26utm_source%3Dhs_email%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_content%3D2%26_hsenc%3Dp2ANqtz--yCQE6JnCdDMlgkNcm8c1oRcfcMCjPKOop7bUmyYUVwCv-i-yWIQ0UKGoOe7aGdXFIUv3xV7LPcwf7OA2Pg6rAO4hUXQ%26_hsmi%3D2&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1742197085148792&usg=AOvVaw1WhvnK4J9PUpKyLg0Yj7k2): “The federal government spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year on contracts, which consume a large portion of the federal budget. In FY 2023 alone, the federal government spent over $750 billion on contracts for a wide variety of goods and services—from cybersecurity software to consulting services to aircraft carriers—that are critical to the success of agency missions.”
 
**(3) Uncertainty & capital spending. **
There may be methods behind Trump’s tariffs and federal government job cuts, but they certainly have heightened uncertainty and anxiety about the economic outlook. There’s a strong correlation between the CEO Economic Outlook Index (compiled by the Round Table) and the yearly growth rate in capital spending in nominal GDP. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1108/1b8f3875-184045.png)

Policy uncertainty and fears of a trade war are bound to depress business confidence and capital spending. The uncertainty index, compiled by the National Federation of Independent Business in a monthly survey of small business owners, has been very volatile and elevated since Election Day.

**(4) AI bubble bursting.** 
The Magnificent-7 companies are expected to spend a total of $325 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, $100 billion more than in 2024. This includes $75 billion of spending by Alphabet, $80 billion by Microsoft, $100 billion by Amazon, and $65 billion by Meta Platforms. It is widely assumed that this is mostly for AI infrastructure.
 
The fear now is that open-source large language models (LLMs) like DeepSeek and Manus, developed in China, require much less powerful semiconductors to operate. If so, then AI capital spending will tumble along with the profit margins on AI systems. Since DeepSeek was introduced on January 24, the Roundhill Magnificent-7 ETF (MAGS) is down 15.4%.

**(5) Trade war & global growth.**
Globalization has been the main driving force behind global economic prosperity. Global industrial production has been rising along with the volume of global exports for years.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1108/6e9eb2ef-139790.png)
 ▌*View Related Live Charts:  [World - Global Trade Volume](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/3526/global-trade-supply-chain/27925/world-trade-volume)*

Supply chains have become globalized, so products assembled in one country have parts manufactured all over the world.
 
If Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, which are scheduled to be imposed on April 2, lead to negotiations that result in deals to lower tariffs, that would be a very good outcome. If instead they exacerbate the global trade war, which has already started, that would be very bad.

In February, Trump directed his advisers to come up with new tariff levels that take into account the various trade barriers and other economic approaches employed by America’s trading partners. That includes not only the tariffs that other countries charge on US products but also the subsidies they provide to their domestic industries, their exchange rates, and other measures that the President deems unfair.
 
That’s fine, but this approach of shooting with reciprocal tariffs first and then talking later might quickly escalate into a trade war with a retaliatory tariffs spiral.
 
**(6) The end of American Exceptionalism.** 
Only a few months ago, American Exceptionalism was widely heralded, including in front-[cover stories](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2024-10-19?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--yCQE6JnCdDMlgkNcm8c1oRcfcMCjPKOop7bUmyYUVwCv-i-yWIQ0UKGoOe7aGdXFIUv3xV7LPcwf7OA2Pg6rAO4hUXQ&_hsmi=2) in the media. Indeed, the October 19, 2024 cover story in The Economist was titled “The Envy of the World.” It was a special report on the American economy. With the benefit of hindsight, that might have been an important contrary indicator, an example of the “front-cover curse” I’ve often mentioned.
 
Another contrary indicator was the substantial $289.0 billion in net purchases of US equities by private foreign investors through December 2024.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1108/08d495f4-223935.png)

As we have previously observed, foreign net inflows into US equities tend to be large near tops in the US stock market.
 
If American Exceptionalism has peaked, then it did so on December 24, 2024 when the ratio of the MSCI US stock price index to the MSCI All Country World (ACW) ex-US index (in dollars) peaked.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1108/85aa67c6-183625.png)

The ratio has dropped sharply since then, though it remains on the upward trend that started in 2010.
 
What has certainly been exceptional about the US stock market is its valuation multiple. Its gap with that of the rest of the world has been widening since 2012.

Even now, while the MSCI US’s forward P/E has dropped two percentage points over the past few weeks to 20.7, that’s still well above the 13.8 of the MSCI AWC ex-US.
 
**(7) The Stock Market Vigilantes.** 
The economy is clearly being stress-tested by the turmoil unleashed by Trump’s tariff campaign and rapid-fire cuts in federal payrolls. The immediate impact has been rapid corrections in the Nasdaq and S&P 500. In effect, the Stock Market Vigilantes (SMV) are giving the administration a thumbs down. If this wild bunch forces stock prices into bear market territory, the negative wealth effect could cause a self-fulfilling recession.
 
The administration seems to be inciting the SMVs to do just that. Trump recently dismissed the significance of the stock market, saying “you can’t really watch the stock market” and “markets are going to go up and they’re going to go down.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (who should know better) also downplayed the recent stock market selloff, calling it “a little bit of volatility over three weeks” that the administration is not concerned about. In effect, they are saying that there is no Trump Put for stock investors. At the same time, Fed officials have said that they are in no rush to provide a Fed Put, which in the past often made significant stock market bottoms.
 
#### Strategy III: The Bull Case. 
Now for an uplifting change, let’s review the bull case. To an important extent, it hinges on the resilience of the US economy. Over the past three years, the economy has demonstrated its resilience by growing despite widespread forecasts that fueled fears of a recession caused by the significant tightening of monetary policy. The lesson that should have been learned is that the US economy can perform remarkably well despite Washington’s constant meddling with it. Actually, that’s been true for a very long time.
 
Consider the following:
 
**(1) Resilient consumers.** 
We continue to monitor the weekly Redbook Research retail sales series, which is highly correlated with the monthly retail sales series compiled by the Census Bureau. The former was up solidly at 5.7% y/y during the March 7 week. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1108/9efa761b-228050.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Retail Sales](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/86/retail-sales)*

The growth rate of department store sales, which has been around zero in recent years, rose to 1.5% in the latest week, while discount store sales increased 6.9%.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1108/4640c273-201638.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Redbook Same-Store Retail Sales Index (YoY)](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/3/us-consumption-relative/23462/us-redbook-same-store-index)*
 
**(2) Resilient labor market.** 
So far, weekly initial unemployment claims suggest that the labor market remains tight: Claims have stayed around 220,000 since the last week of January, excluding a blip to 242,000 during the week of February 21.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1108/79a97d11-164195.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Initial & Continuing Jobless Claims](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/3/us-consumption-relative/23462/us-redbook-same-store-index)*

Separate data for federal government employees’ unemployment claims have spiked during the past two weeks, but to only around 1,600 per week.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1108/a21a4dcf-676275.png)

Recent surveys of job openings conducted by the Conference Board, the National Federation of Independent Business, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that openings remain ample.

**(3) No Tech Wreck likely. **
While cloud computing vendors might need to spend less to increase their capacity to run LLMs as a result of DeepSeek, they will still have to expand their datacenter capacity significantly to process and store more AI-related data.
 
We don’t think that there is a significant valuation problem in the S&P 500 Communication Services and Information Technology sectors—certainly nothing comparable to the technology bubble of the late 1990s. Together, these sectors account for about 40% of the market capitalization of the S&P 500, matching the peak in late 1999 and early 2000, just before the Tech Wreck. However, there’s more earnings justification this time: Their share of the S&P 500’s forward earnings is currently 35%, well exceeding the 22% peak just before the Tech Wreck.

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1108/e850ee22-126789.png)
 
**(4) The Fed Put is on standby. **
Fed officials have frequently stated that they are in no hurry to lower interest rates. That’s a dovish stance since it implies that they are focusing on lowering the federal funds rate, not raising it or holding it steady. If Trump’s policies show signs of pushing the economy into a recession, the Fed will act quickly to lower interest rates. That assumes, as we do, that inflation remains subdued at just a bit north of the Fed’s target of 2.0%. The Trump Put may be kaput, but the Fed Put remains on standby.
 
**(5) Stock market sentiment is so bad. **
The Investors Intelligence Bull/Bear Ratio dropped to 0.80 last week. Readings below 1.00 have been strong buying signals in the past, though they can stay below 1.00 for some time before the market clearly bottoms. The AAII Bull/Bear Ratio is also very bearish, which is bullish from a contrarian perspective.
 
From a sentiment perspective, it is possible that Thursday’s selloff followed by Friday’s rally marked a bottom in the correction. We will be more inclined to call a bottom when we see the stock market move higher on a day or days when Trump blusters about tariffs again, which he did not do on Friday. Any day without a Trump tariff comment is a good day for the market. We know that on April 2 there will be lots of reciprocal tariffs imposed on many more nations by the administration, undoubtedly eliciting lots of comments from Tariff Man.
 
**(6) Bottom line.** 
We repeat ourselves: It all depends on the often-unpredictable President, who frequently—and proudly—has referred to himself as “Tariff Man,” reflecting his strong support for protectionist trade policies.
 
#### Strategy IV: RIP, Roaring 2020s? 
While there’s lots of uncertainty for now about the short-term outlook for the economy, we remain believers in our Roaring 2020s scenario, which we started to write about in 2019. That call worked out well during the first half of the decade. Along the way, we often were reminded that the Roaring 1920s ended badly because of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, which was passed in June 1930. Unfortunately, such a scenario could happen again if Trump turns out to be a protectionist and triggers a global trade war.
 
In other words, we can’t dismiss the possibility that Trump will convert our Roaring 2020s scenario into the New Global Disorder of the 2030s—the analogy being the terrible 1930s.
 
Before that happens, we would expect lots of pushback from constituencies of Republican congressional representatives clamoring for an end to the tariff turmoil. The Republicans have very narrow majorities in both houses of Congress. They can expect to lose both those majorities if Trump uses tariffs to pursue protectionism, causing increasing retaliatory tariffs and a recession, rather than using them to negotiate freer trade by lowering tariffs in a reciprocal fashion to promote global prosperity.

The global market has entered a turbulent phase, driven by escalating trade tensions and mounting fears of a potential recession. Recent trade policy uncertainty, including tariff hikes and comments from Trump, has led investors to seek safe havens and reevaluate asset valuations. MacroMicro’s [Weekly Economic and Financial Commentary (WEFC)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kN4oYi4DDPRyKiTEWvDVeKBDkxe3JFmg/view?usp=sharing) offers critical insights, helping investors navigate volatility and distinguish between short-term noise and fundamental trends.



*With recession fears, trade war concerns, and shifting central bank policies shaping the landscape, here’s what investors need to watch next:*


[![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1109/5ab07ba0-393560.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kN4oYi4DDPRyKiTEWvDVeKBDkxe3JFmg/view?usp=sharing)



#### 1. Market Volatility Amid Trade Tensions:

Global markets slumped due to renewed tariff concerns, notably following Trump's announcements and weaker-than-expected tech earnings. Investors shifted towards safe assets like gold, pushing prices above $3,000/oz.

#### 2. Recession Fears Potentially Overblown:

Despite a sharp decline in the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow estimate (-2.4%), deeper analysis suggests recession fears may be overstated, influenced by temporary factors such as gold imports and weather-related disruptions.

#### 3. Inflation Cooling as CPI Moderates:

February’s CPI growth eased to 2.81% YoY, returning to a downward trajectory after a temporary January spike. Key service sectors, especially housing and transportation, showed significant disinflation.

#### 4. Germany’s Massive Fiscal Expansion Boosts Euro:

Germany’s €500 billion infrastructure and defense spending plans, coupled with the EU’s €800 billion military investments, strengthened the euro and elevated German bond yields, narrowing the U.S.-EU yield spread.

#### 5. Trump Administration’s Economic Impact:

Trump's policy shifts, including potential deportations (250K–500K immigrants), substantial cuts in government employment (200K+ jobs), and uncertain tariff impacts, are expected to moderately increase unemployment but without significant recession risks.

#### 6. Fear and Greed Index Signals Extreme Fear:

The MacroMicro U.S. Fear and Greed Index dropped sharply, indicating ""extreme fear."" Historical data suggests high probabilities (75%+) for market rebounds after such sentiment extremes, signaling potential opportunities for investors.

"1104","Yardeni Research | High Noise-To-Signal Ratios Unnerving Stock Investors","high-noisetosignal-ratios-unnerving-stock-investors","2025-03-12","#### Executive Summary: 
It’s getting harder to make out the shape of the economy through the fog of Trump 2.0’s firings and tariffs. Indeed, one regional Fed bank sees real GDP contracting this quarter, another sees it expanding, and bad weather has distorted signals from several economic indicators. No wonder the stock market’s default position is risk-off and stocks have been correcting. We’ve lost some confidence that the economy will avoid a recession, raising the odds of one to 35%, up from 20%, last week. And we’re wondering whether Trump Tariff Turmoil 2.0 might trigger a rare kind of flash crash unaccompanied by a recession.  … Check out the accompanying [chart collection](https://yardeni.com/wp-content/uploads/cc_20250310.pdf).

#### Strategy I: The Economy’s High NTSR.
The economy’s noise-to-signal ratio (NTSR) has been rising rapidly in recent weeks. As a result, it has gotten harder to get a read on the economy lately. Washington’s rapidly increasing NTSR is also troubling. Indeed, last Wednesday, our [Morning Briefing](https://yardeni.com/wp-content/uploads/mb_20250305.pdf?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8ONrnSbxLaYdXYLsrzLrneiDQU3w_WTNT3tnEbAScf6YLhsjB8BjssFSAH28wufiCp_rrEleCyBgUMdbj_sEvP041XOg&_hsmi=2) was titled “Trump Turmoil Raises Odds Of A Recession.” We raised our subjective odds of a recession this year from 20% to 35%.
 
We are considering raising the odds again given that Trump officials recently acknowledged that they expect that their policies will cause some short-term pain. The near-term outlook for the economy and stock market has soured rapidly over the past few weeks.
 
The DOGE Boys have been firing government workers faster than we expected. That might slow now that various Cabinet secretaries reportingly are pushing back against Elon Musk’s terminators. The Trump administration’s tariff policies are instigating a retaliatory trade war rather than the negotiations to reduce tariffs that we had expected. More “reciprocal” tariffs will be imposed on April 2 by the Trump administration, which also aims to raise revenues with tariffs, implying that some of the tariffs will be permanent.
 
Stock investors are confused and seem to have concluded that the economy may be falling quickly into a recession. We’ve been betting on the economy’s resilience, but we can understand why risk-off is the stock market’s current default option.
 
The Nasdaq is in correction territory, and the S&P 500 seems to be headed in the same direction.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1104/aace55de-175032.png)

The Nasdaq fell below its 200-day moving average at the end of last week and has found support at the bottom end of its short-term upward trending channel. There is another uptrend line that started in 2010, which would provide support for the Nasdaq but in bear market territory.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - NASDAQ Composite](https://en.macromicro.me/series/32/nasdaq-composite)*

The Nasdaq index is currently 9.8% below its record high of 20173.89 on December 16.
 
The S&P 500 is down 6.1% from its record high on February 19.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - CNN Fear and Greed Index](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/34/us-stock-relative/50108/cnn-fear-and-greed)*

It is slightly below its 200-day moving average. It has been a very rapid decline. It reminds us of the plunge in the S&P 500 during the Kennedy Slide of 1962 (also known as the “Flash Crash of 1962”). The stock market did not experience a stable recovery until after the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [MM US Stock Fundamental Index](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/34/us-stock-relative/444/us-mm-gspc)*

The crash was partly attributable to a big price increase by US Steel that was loudly and successfully opposed by the Kennedy administration. This time, the selloff is largely attributable to Trump Tariff Turmoil 2.0.
 
Corrections are caused by fears that the economy is falling into a recession. During these events, stock prices fall 10%-20%. But they recover relatively quickly once those fears abate. During the bull market from 2009 through 2020, we [***counted***](www.google.com/url?q=https://yardeni.com/wp-content/uploads/panicattacktable.pdf?utm_campaign%3DMorning%2520Briefing%26utm_source%3Dhs_email%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_content%3D2%26_hsenc%3Dp2ANqtz-8ONrnSbxLaYdXYLsrzLrneiDQU3w_WTNT3tnEbAScf6YLhsjB8BjssFSAH28wufiCp_rrEleCyBgUMdbj_sEvP041XOg%26_hsmi%3D2&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1741580389445756&usg=AOvVaw2zB59k2spD61WolbL3Px6m) 66 “panic attacks,” which included a few corrections. Bear markets occur when the correction turns into a decline of more than 20%, usually because a recession happens. There have been only three bear markets that occurred without an accompanying recession: the one in 1962, the one late in 1987, and the one in 2022.
 
There is certainly a recession scare currently. Our bet on the resilience of the economy is keeping us in the correction camp. However, Trump Tariff Turmoil 2.0 has the potential to cause a fourth bear market without a recession.
 
Yes, but what about the latest batch of economic indicators that are heightening recession fears? 
Consider the following:
 
**(1) Atlanta Fed versus New York Fed Nowcasts.** 
The Atlanta Fed’s [GDPNow](https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/cqer/researchcq/gdpnow/RealGDPTrackingSlides.pdf?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8ONrnSbxLaYdXYLsrzLrneiDQU3w_WTNT3tnEbAScf6YLhsjB8BjssFSAH28wufiCp_rrEleCyBgUMdbj_sEvP041XOg&_hsmi=2) tracking model is currently showing Q1’s real GDP decreasing by 2.4% (q/q saar). However, the New York Fed’s [*Nowcast*](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/nowcast?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8ONrnSbxLaYdXYLsrzLrneiDQU3w_WTNT3tnEbAScf6YLhsjB8BjssFSAH28wufiCp_rrEleCyBgUMdbj_sEvP041XOg&_hsmi=2#/nowcast) tracking model shows it increasing 2.7%! Go figure.
 
We usually favor the Atlanta Fed model over the New York Fed one. However, this time, we are betting on the New York Fed’s forecast. We don’t know why the two models differ so much.
 
What we do know is that the Atlanta Fed estimate dropped from +2.3% to -1.5% following the release on February 28 of a big jump in January’s imports, led by an odd jump in gold imports. In addition, on that same day, January’s real personal consumption expenditures showed a big decline of -0.5% m/m. The GDPNow estimate was lowered again to -2.8% on March 3 after the release of the ISM manufacturing index for February. It is currently -2.4%.
 
**(2) Surging (gold) imports.** 
In a March 7 [post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gdp-forecasters-some-gold-doesnt-glitter-atlantafed-fxb2e/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8ONrnSbxLaYdXYLsrzLrneiDQU3w_WTNT3tnEbAScf6YLhsjB8BjssFSAH28wufiCp_rrEleCyBgUMdbj_sEvP041XOg&_hsmi=2) on LinkedIn, Pat Higgins, the creator of GDPNow, explained that much of the widening of the trade deficit in January was due to an increase in nonmonetary gold imports from $13.2 billion in December to $32.6 billion in January. This accounted for nearly 60% of the widening of the goods trade deficit. Higgins concluded: “Removing gold from imports and exports leads to an increase in both GDPNow’s topline growth forecast and the contribution of net exports to that forecast, of about 2 percentage points.” That’s obviously a significant swing.
 
**(3) Weak (and strong) retail sales.** 
Furthermore, the drop in real consumer spending during January undoubtedly was caused by inclement weather that month, which was the coldest since 1988. Industrial output of utilities soared to a record high in January.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1104/0dc8d5ee-204748.png)

Auto sales fell sharply in January and rebounded slightly in February.

Retail sales excluding food services dropped 1.2% m/m during January. Again, we blame the weather. Nevertheless, it still rose 4.0% y/y.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Retail Sales](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/86/retail-sales)*

The Redbook retail sales index rose to 6.1% y/y during the February 28 week. Then again, the Consumer Confidence Index survey showed a sharp decline in vacation plans during February.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Consumer Confidence](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/3/us-consumption-relative/22/consumer-confidence)*
 
Furthermore, Target said on Tuesday that it expects little to no sales growth this year, with CEO Brian Cornell telling CNBC that higher prices are on the way. Walmart and electronics retailer Best Buy also recently warned about expectations for 2025.
 
**(4) Mixed signals from the PMIs.** 
February’s purchasing managers added to the dissonance provided by the latest batch of economic indicators. The M-PMI dipped to 50.3 in February from 50.9 in January.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1104/bc0dac64-281349.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - ISM Manufacturing PMI](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/54/ism)*

However, those were the first back-to-back readings above 50.0 since September and October 2022. Then again, February’s M-PMI subindexes for new orders (48.6) and employment (47.6) fell below 50.0. The regional business surveys conducted by five of the 12 Fed district banks showed better growth during February.
 
February’s NM-PMI remained solidly above 50.0 at 53.5.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1104/8373ee73-332256.png)

All its major subindexes did the same. Just as we expected, the S&P Global flash NM-PMI provided a misleadingly weak estimate of the ISM version of this index.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1104/bccd5e65-129626.png)
 
#### Strategy II: Labor Market’s High NTSR. 
Friday’s employment report for February also provided plenty of mixed signals. The payroll employment series (which measures the number of full-time and part-time jobs) rose 151,000, while the household employment series (which measures the number of workers with one or more jobs) fell 588,000. The latter is very volatile. It was up 2.2 million during January following an annual benchmark revision. The former was weaker than we expected, as we had anticipated a rebound from January’s cold blast. Well, it turns out that the weather was also bad in February. Consider the following:
 
**(1) Bad weather again?** 
The household employment [survey](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU02036012%26years_option=all_years?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8ONrnSbxLaYdXYLsrzLrneiDQU3w_WTNT3tnEbAScf6YLhsjB8BjssFSAH28wufiCp_rrEleCyBgUMdbj_sEvP041XOg&_hsmi=2) shows that 404,000 nonagricultural workers were not at work during February, the most since February 2014. The [survey](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU02033224%26yearsoption=allyears?utmcampaign=Morning%20Briefing&utmsource=hsemail&utmmedium=email&utmcontent=2&hsenc=p2ANqtz-8ONrnSbxLaYdXYLsrzLrneiDQU3wWTNT3tnEbAScf6YLhsjB8BjssFSAH28wufiCprrEleCyBgUMdbjsEvP041XOg&hsmi=2) also found that 1.31 million nonagricultural workers who work full time had to work part time last month because of the weather. That’s the most since February 2021.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1104/59b65181-165561.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Household Survey Employment - Workers Not at Work because of Weather](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/114052/us-employment-level-with-a-job-not-at-work-bad-weather)*
 
We had expected average weekly hours to rebound in February. Instead, it remained flat at January’s level. If bad weather depressed both months’ readings, then there should be a solid rebound in average weekly hours during March.
 
**(2) Payroll employment.** 
While February’s payroll employment gain was weaker than we’d expected, the three-month average gain was 200,000.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1104/670cb72a-835187.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Nonfarm Payrolls vs. Unemployment Rate](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4/us-employ-relative/6/employment-condition)*

That’s a robust reading. Excluding government, the three-month average was 169,000. That’s also a solid reading.
 
The questions ahead are how much will federal government employment fall in coming months as a result of the activities of the DOGE Boys, and will private payroll gains more than offset the losses of federal jobs? We think so, though this is certainly one of the great uncertainties resulting from Trump Turmoil 2.0. The losses started in February with federal government employment down 10,000.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1104/851e2445-129086.png)

This number could potentially double, triple, or even quadruple in coming months.
 
**(3) Earned income proxy.** 
During February, private-sector payrolls rose 0.1%, the average workweek for private-sector workers was unchanged, and average hourly earnings in the private sector rose 0.3%. So our Earned Income Proxy edged up 0.4% m/m.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1104/2d0f7fde-201229.png)

We expect bigger rebounds in February’s retail sales and total consumer spending from January’s deep freeze, unless bad weather kept shoppers at home during February too.
 
**(4) Unemployment and layoffs.** 
The bad news is that February’s [Challenger Report](https://www.challengergray.com/blog/job-cuts-surge-on-doge-actions-retail-woes-highest-monthly-total-since-july-2020/?utmcampaign=Morning%20Briefing&utmsource=hsemail&utmmedium=email&utmcontent=2&hsenc=p2ANqtz-8ONrnSbxLaYdXYLsrzLrneiDQU3wWTNT3tnEbAScf6YLhsjB8BjssFSAH28wufiCprrEleCyBgUMdbjsEvP041XOg&hsmi=2) showed that government-announced layoffs totaled 62,240.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1104/cacb84e5-112547.png)

The private sector isn’t likely to significantly offset such job cuts if they all hit in March and April, especially since the Trump administration is planning even more layoffs.
 
In the private sector, announced layoffs in retailing during February totaled 38,960, the second highest tally on record. Retail payrolls fell 6,300 during the month. Information employment rose 5,000 last month. Announced layoffs in technology totaled 14,550. This means that we should expect sizeable increases in weekly initial and continuing unemployment claims in coming weeks.
 
While the official headline unemployment rate remained low at 4.1% during February, the U-6 rate rose to 8.0%, the highest since 2021.

We continue to bet on the resilience of the American economy. Yes, the [Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/2/us-gdp-relative/24628/us-atlanta-fed-nowcast) lowered its Q1 GDP forecast significantly on Friday. The volatile model swung in response to January’s surge in imported goods ahead of Trump’s tariffs. In addition, consumer spending was depressed by a colder-than-usual January, but consumer spending and the model are bound to rebound in February. Eric explains why we believe pessimism about the economic outlook is unwarranted. … Also: The uncertainty introduced by Trump 2.0’s flurry of aggressive actions has lured bears out of their caves.

#### Strategy I: Addressing the Growth Scare 
On Friday, the Atlanta Fed’s [Q1 GDPNow model](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HQgZZtsgYcq41xqRB-GcYvlBs38KscIpWnA4JqbhW0kqsYdkQzTJ5RxX1GUFDqC_S88EdLEVtOiK-NgwbigFzDHLG6g&_hsmi=2) fell from 2.3% to -1.5% (q/q, saar).

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/2/us-gdp-relative/24628/us-atlanta-fed-nowcast)*

Naturally, that amplified the ongoing concerns that the US economy is quickly slowing, perhaps due to uncertainty attributable to Trump 2.0. While much of the drop in the model’s estimate did have to do with Trump 2.0, January’s trade data that triggered it don’t portend a significant economic slowdown. Neither do January’s consumption data, in our opinion. Both were released on Friday.
 
Here’s more:
 
**(1) Frontrunning tariffs.**
In the GDP calculation, when US imports rise faster than exports, that weighs on real GDP growth. In January, goods imports soared to a record high, causing the trade deficit to widen 70% y/y to $153.3 billion, or a $1.8 trillion annualized deficit.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/79055c0d-115313.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Exports vs Imports](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/6/us-trade-relative/17/exports-imports)*

The bulk of this surge represented importers getting ahead of potential tariff increases. Imports of industrial supplies increased by 63.2%, and imports of consumer goods rose by 25.9%.
 
The trade data went from weighing on the GDPNow model’s expected Q1 growth by -0.41% to -3.70%, leading to the huge swing.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/1ecb317b-86055.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/2/us-gdp-relative/24628/us-atlanta-fed-nowcast)*
 
 **(2) Wait for the February data. **
The problem with the GDPNow model is that it can be erratic, and its latest swing catches only the surge in imports. The reason net exports are subtracted from overall GDP is that usually imports are already accounted for in consumption and inventory investment data—that’s why they typically correlate with US economic growth. Consumption was weak in January because of the coldest January weather since 2011. We expect that consumption will rebound while imports weaken in February and March. If so, then real GDP should grow at least 1.5% in Q1 and 2.5% in Q2.
 
**(3) Markets’ reaction,**
The 10-year Treasury yield now stands just below the bottom of our 2025 expected range of 4.25%-4.75%, hovering around 4.20%.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/0295a25d-202821.png)

It had been around 4.25% on Friday—and stocks had been up on the day—until Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s public meeting with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance turned into a chaotic shouting match. Stocks managed to finish the day higher thanks to some month-end markups (or window dressing).
 
In any event, the markets may be reading too much into the trade data that are temporarily weighing on GDP expectations. We’re still expecting a rebound in the February and March economic data; however, growth will likely slow during Q1 and perhaps Q2 before accelerating in the back half of the year as uncertainty fades.
 
#### Strategy II: Animal Spirits Trump Uncertainty
If you’re searching for a bearish narrative, take your pick. Bearish prognosticators have been licking their wounds since the no-show recession of 2022 and 2023 and since the 2024 summer slowdown proved to be a head fake. Trump 2.0 seems to be bringing them out of hibernation.
 
Among the many economic challenges ahead cited by the growing cohort of bears are:
* Fiscal stimulus will diminish, weighing directly on GDP. In other words, a fiscal cliff is coming soon.
* Consumers will retrench because they are too leveraged or have run out of excess savings.
* The positives of Trump 2.0’s pro-business stance are outweighed by the negatives of policy uncertainty, drummed up by daily executive orders and tariff announcements. This uncertainty will restrain capital spending and is already spurring a slowdown in the services economy.
* The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is slashing the federal workforce and contracted workers. That will jack up unemployment and knock down consumer spending.
* Should DOGE fail in its aims of narrowing the budget and slowing the growth in federal spending, then higher interest rates and a fiscal crisis are inevitable. Corporate defaults, slimmer profit margins, and lower stock prices surely would follow. The reduced net wealth effect would weigh doubly on consumer spending. Construction employment would suffer from the housing market malaise under higher rates.


So whether DOGE succeeds or fails, the thinking goes, the economy is doomed. Woe is us! The wall of worry grows a brick row higher each day. 
 
We believe the current uncertainty will be offset by the US economy’s dynamism. The economy has demonstrated its resilience since the pandemic started. That’s especially true over the past three years, when monetary policy turned restrictive to beat down inflation yet the economy continued to grow. There hasn’t been a recession since the pandemic lockdowns during the first two quarters of 2020.
 
We expect that pro-business policies, as they emerge, will boost longer-term confidence, allaying short-term uncertainties related to Trump 2.0. We think the naysayers are hanging too much significance on what drove economic growth in the years that followed the pandemic and not enough on what will drive it going forward.
 
Ironically, their excuse for being wrong in expecting a recession over the past three years is that fiscal policy was stimulative, which staved off the downturn. Now that it is likely to turn less stimulative, the odds of a recession are increasing again, in their opinion. That is such yesterday thinking! We are thinking ahead to tomorrow, focused on future developments that are already stimulating the economy such as the tech-led productivity boom at the crux of our Roaring 2020s outlook. In short, our long-held bullish stance remains intact.
 
#### Consider some rebuttals to the bears’ concerns:
 
**(1) Government vs private sector spending.** 
There’s a certain fatalism in believing that the US economy is heading for a debt crisis but at the same time believing that anything done to avert it would plunge the economy into a recession caused by a fiscal cliff anyway. 
 
Some chalk up America’s real GDP growth in the post-pandemic period mostly to massive fiscal stimulus. We agree that the pandemic-time fiscal stimulus was excessive, as the sticky inflationary pressures still evident four years later attest. But more importantly, we believe that the private sector can offset the slowdown in government spending and is likely to do so by allocating capital to more productive projects and sectors.
 
For instance, the Biden administration focused too much on electric vehicles and green energy and not enough on semiconductors, defense, and the electric grid. The CHIPS and Science Act (around $53 billion in appropriated funds) paled in comparison to the Inflation Reduction Act (a $400 billion hit to the federal deficit), and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (around $550 billion in new spending). 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/6b28762f-167805.png)

But the AI boom is already boosting massive private-sector spending on R&D, information processing equipment, and software, which now account for half of all nonresidential fixed investment.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/164b1be8-111349.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [Big Tech - Magnificent 7 CapEx (Cumulative Total)](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4093/us-big-tech/109709/big-techs-m7-capex)*

Between Apple’s latest announcement and Stargate (Microsoft/OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank), there’s $1 trillion of planned capital spending over the next four years.
 
**(2) Offering outlay relief.**
We were encouraged by the latest budget bill passed by the House of Representatives, which includes $2 trillion of directed spending cuts over the next decade. All else equal, lower federal spending means slower economic growth. If federal spending does fall by $2 trillion by 2035, GDP growth will be lower unless consumption and investment rise and/or the trade deficit narrows. We are optimistic that all three of these will occur.
 
Can personal consumption expenditures and fixed investment increase by an extra $2 trillion over the next 10 years? Certainly. Consumption is 68% of GDP, or $19 trillion, and will likely breach $25 trillion within the next decade.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/e9041126-190981.png)

Investment is 18% of GDP, or $5 trillion, and will likely breach $7 trillion. Given our expectations that productivity growth reaches 3.0%-3.5% by 2030, an extra $2 trillion is achievable.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/330ff556-1227225.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Nonfarm Payrolls vs. Unemployment Rate](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4/us-employ-relative/6/employment-condition)*


We expect both tax cuts and deregulation to accelerate consumption and capital spending, helping to quicken those productivity gains.
 
**(3) Taming trade.**
The trade deficit can also do some lifting. Reducing net exports from the current -3.1% of GDP to -1.5% would improve GDP by $663 billion by 2035 (assuming annualized nominal GDP growth of 4%). So consumption and investment combined would have to pick up by only $1.3 trillion. These are not mutually exclusive events. Increased domestic investment is the likely result of Trump 2.0’s nascent trade policies, which are also aimed at improving the trade deficit. This scenario includes consumers’ spending more on domestically produced goods and services.
 
**(4) Reducing revenues? Or raising them?** 
The $2 trillion of spending cuts in the House bill were paired with $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The reduction in receipts from the baseline would roughly reduce federal revenues by about 1.0%-1.5% of GDP through the next decade.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/595d537b-196513.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Federal Government - Tax Receipts on Corporate Income](https://en.macromicro.me/series/7201/us-federal-tax-on-corporate-income)*

In our opinion, the stimulative impact of lower taxes and encouraged investment in the US will offset a portion of the cuts with higher growth.
 
**(5) Putting a dent in the deficit.** If outlays grow at a 5% average annualized rate—which is roughly average for the 2014-19 period—then the $2 trillion in spending cuts will push federal outlays down to about 20% of GDP. That would be historically normal and consistent with a budget deficit that’s 3% of GDP.

▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Federal Surplus or Deficit (% of GDP)](https://en.macromicro.me/series/366/federal-deficit-of-gdp)*
 
We’re doing very back-of-the-envelope math here, but the point is that lower federal spending is not a doom scenario for the US economy and Trump 2.0’s economic goals are more realistic than they get credit for. In other words, the markets aren’t pricing in these optimistic possibilities.
 
**(6) Consumers keeping it cool, not cooling**
The US consumer is fine. Since the root cause of rising unemployment last year was mostly immigration and increased labor force participation, we do not believe DOGE-related firings will spiral into mass layoffs.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/c22190cd-159984.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Unemployment Rate](https://en.macromicro.me/series/37/unemployment-rate)*

Government employees make up just 12.5% of total payrolls, and state and local governments should be less affected by DOGE than the federal government.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/912be25f-176620.png)

As long as the unemployment rate remains in the 4.0%-4.5% range that we expect—which is likely now that immigration has slowed substantially—consumers will continue to spend apace.

Wages are going up. …So you are starting to see what I put at normal. Credit costs have normalized. So it’s just almost back to what I call a normal environment.”
 
Dimon was among the most worried about the consumer throughout 2022 and 2023. As he suggests, real wages are rising.

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/b6df8f08-231858.png)
 
**(7) Uncertainty abounds.** 
Certainty is good for business. The outlook has gotten more uncertain over the past few months.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/59782ac7-114013.png)

But we do not expect this uncertainty to persist. While the S&P Global NM-PMI contracted slightly this month, it tends to be more volatile than the ISM NM-PMI.

Last month marked the index’s first foray into expansion territory since the Fed started tightening in early 2022 and suggests the manufacturing sector has finally entered a rolling recovery.
 
**(8) Housing horror show.**
The housing market has been a mess for several years, if not since the turn of the century. With overall construction employment around record highs, several observers have insinuated that the economy is entering a cyclical slowdown as housing permits and starts fall.

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/c610c78d-167566.png)

  ▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Housing Starts vs. Building Permits](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/7/us-housing-relative/30/housing-start)*

But as Austin, Texas shows us (see this recent Bloomberg [story](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/7/us-housing-relative/30/housing-start)), deregulation is the answer to high home prices. We believe Trump 2.0 will tackle this on a national level, stimulating more housing starts and permits and thereby keeping employment elevated.
 
Meanwhile, the supply of construction employment has fallen with decreased immigration, so employers are likely to hold onto their workers. And though many in construction are working on nonresidential buildings, it’s notable that roughly half of residential construction employment is remodelers.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/bd0a165e-834632.png)

That suggests that construction employment is relatively shielded from any potential housing slowdown, and that construction skills are transferable across different types of projects.
 
**(9) Winning with the wealth effect **
The excess-savings-depleting story that led to a lot of worry about the economic outlook over the past couple years was a nonstarter, in our opinion, mostly because retiring Baby Boomers were sitting on huge nest eggs that continued to appreciate. Between near-record stock prices and high home prices, the Baby Boomers now hold roughly $83 trillion of the $160 trillion in US household wealth.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/ae416555-73430.png)

So we haven’t been worried about the relatively low personal savings rate; in fact, we think it may fall into negative territory by the end of the decade.
 
Could the wealth effect reverse? A bear market in stocks and much lower home prices likely would lead consumers and businesses to pull back some of their spending. But that would be likely only in a recession, which we see as improbable at the moment. If a recession were to become more likely, automatic stabilizers and the ease-first-ask-questions-later Fed would quickly restimulate markets and the economy. Both a recession and a fiscal crisis are in our 20%-probability what-could-go-wrong bucket of economic scenarios. We still apply an 80% subjective probability to outcomes that are bullish for US stocks.

In February, global equity markets saw a shift as previously underperforming regions emerged as frontrunners. [European](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/181/msci-eur-index/2108/mm-eur-index) and [Russian](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/101/rts-index/38690/oil-and-natural-gas-export-vs-rts-index) stocks surged, reflecting a rising probability of Russia-Ukraine peace talks ending the war. The [Hang Seng Index](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/1658/hk-stock-relative/13737/hk-hsi-volatility-index-vs-hsi) and the [CSI 300](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/55/cn-shanghai-shengzhen-csi-300-index/824/mm-sse-composite-fundamentals-index) benefited from the tech-driven rally led by DeepSeek. Meanwhile, U.S. equities briefly hit a new all-time high before seeing a modest pullback, and we’re starting to see more rotation overall. The [U.S. Dollar Index](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/1767/us-dollar) and [Treasury yields](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/51/us-treasury-bond/761/us-10year-treasury-bond) retreated during the month, indicating ample liquidity. Gold reached new highs, while [oil prices](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/19/mm-oil-price) remained at a safe level of around $70 per barrel. 

February was dominated by news headlines, particularly with Trump wielding tariff threats on a global scale. A key difference from his previous term is that his policy directives are being implemented more swiftly and broadly in scope, moving from targeting specific goods to almost broad-based coverage. This is also starting to manifest in forward-looking economic indicators—February’s [UMich one-year inflation expectations](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/5/us-price-relative/22021/mit-expected-inflation-rate) rose to 4.3%, while the 5-year expectations hit 3.5%, the highest in two decades! The final reading of the [UMich Consumer Sentiment Index](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/3/us-consumption-relative/22/consumer-confidence) for the month also fell from 67.8 to 64.7, highlighting market concerns over Trump’s policies. So how should we interpret these developments?  

**Below, we highlight three key points to address the concerns you may have over Trump’s recent policy moves, and how the accompanying market volatility may present decent opportunities:** 

---

#### 1. Trump's Strategy Centers on Deal-Making, and Countries Are Inclined to Show Goodwill 

Firstly, despite the extensive nature of Trump’s latest tariff moves, his approach follows a clear strategy of **“go broad first, and negotiate later”**, and **as long as countries are willing to cooperate, the president will likely soften his stance**. For instance, Trump initially announced a 25% tariff on all goods from neighboring Canada and Mexico, but the tariffs were postponed after both nations expressed willingness to cooperate on drug enforcement and border security. Similarly, as Trump announced plans for reciprocal tariffs on a global scale, the Indian Prime Minister was on a two-day visit to Washington, which resulted in the two nations’ commitment to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement within the next 6-8 months. Meanwhile, on February 21, the White House issued the “America First Investment Policy” memorandum, emphasizing plans to bolster investment from allies and curbing participation from foreign adversaries such as China. This again underscores that Trump’s policies are not aimed at undermining global markets, but rather prioritizing U.S. interests through negotiations. 

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/527c4778-982158.png)

 ---

#### 2. Inflation Remains in Check, Fed to Pause Balance Sheet Reduction in Q2 

The second factor that suggests the current situation remains under control is that while Trump is pushing for tariffs, he is also facilitating peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, maintaining oil price stability and keeping [WTI crude oil](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/19/mm-oil-price/182/mm-oil-expectation-index) at a relatively low level of $70 per barrel. As shown in the chart below, the latest [Truflation U.S. Inflation Index](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/5/us-price-relative/116496/us-truflation-index-yoy) data suggests that real inflation has not risen like inflation expectations. The index takes into account data from companies like Amazon, Walmart, and Zillow, which also showed notable price declines in February, leading to more anchored rate expectations as reflected in the [policy rate curve implied by interest rate futures](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4238/us-federal/120135/us-implied-policy-rate-curve-from-interest-rate-futures). **Even better news came from the FOMC meeting minutes released on February 19, where committee members explicitly mentioned that the Fed will slow down or pause balance sheet runoff before the debt ceiling issue is resolved (by mid-2025)**, which aligns with our long-held view that the Fed must pause balance sheet drawdown before the [ONRRP facility](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4238/us-federal/34394/us-fed-onrrp-trading-flow) runs out to release liquidity. And this is exactly the direction the Fed is taking.

---

#### 3. AI Is Supporting the Manufacturing Cycle, No Red Flags So Far 

Thirdly, the AI boom and manufacturing cycle we’re closely monitoring continue to exhibit positive momentum. As shown in the chart below, despite an earlier-than-usual Lunar New Year holiday in January, the latest data on [Taiwanese exports](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/13/tw-trade-relative/118/tw-exports-yoy) shows a year-on-year growth of 4.4% in January. The absolute export value even exceeded levels seen in April and May last year, indicating a low probability of export growth turning negative during the first half of this year. Additionally, inventories and customers' inventories from PMI reports of various countries, as well as the [inventory-to-sales ratios in the electronics sector in Taiwan and Korea](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4345/mm-semiconductor/70463/tw-jp-sk-inventory-shipment-ratio-electronics-semiconductors), remain at low levels, reinforcing our view that the manufacturing sector will remain resilient in the first half of the year.

### Market Outlook and Allocation Strategy 

As noted in our January and February house views, we believe Trump’s policies will have limited impact on the long-term trajectory of the U.S. economy and AI development. The three key points above further support this outlook. Recently, we’re also seeing more rotation in the market, for instance, previously lagging regions starting to gain momentum (e.g. [European](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/181/msci-eur-index/2108/mm-eur-index) and [Hong Kong](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/1658/hk-stock-relative/13737/hk-hsi-volatility-index-vs-hsi) equities).

### 1. Tariffs as a Strategic Tool in Trade Negotiations


The Trump administration utilized tariffs as a strategic negotiation tool, rather than merely a protectionist measure.The goal is to pressure countries with high tariffs on U.S. goods to lower their trade barriers. Trump, as a dealmaker, believes in creating agreements where both sides feel they have gained something.

Trump’s objective is to address trade imbalances, national security, and unfair trade practices.

By imposing or threatening tariffs, Trump aims to pressure other countries into making concessions. For instance, after threatening 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, he quickly postponed them for 30 days, as these countries agreed to strengthen border security to prevent illegal immigration and drug trafficking.

---

### 2. Trump’s Tariffs May Not Cause Inflation


Dr. Ed stated that if we were to look at the Trump 1.0 era, we could see that the tariffs imposed on China did not significantly contribute to inflation. A key factor was the tariffs' role in bolstering the U.S. dollar. Even though tariffs may be passed on to consumers, a stronger dollar enabled them to purchase more goods, thereby offsetting the impact of the tariffs to some extent.

---

### 3. No Need for Overconcern About Inflation: PCE Remains Manageable


Recent CPI data indicates favorable trends in goods inflation. Durable goods have even dipped into slight deflation, while food and energy inflation is near zero. Although non-durable goods prices have rebounded slightly, they remain within a reasonable range. This suggests that services inflation remains the primary challenge. Within services, rising auto insurance costs are a major contributor to inflation.

Additionally, rents carry excessive weight in the CPI, and their price stickiness is slowing the pace of disinflation.

Overall, though, PCE inflation—the Fed’s preferred gauge—is at 2.5%, which isn’t too concerning. With a 2% target, the Fed may opt to hold rates steady and let market forces continue driving inflation lower. A rebound in productivity will also play a key role in easing inflation further.

---

### 4. The Roaring 2020s: Dr. Yardeni’s Bullish Market Outlook




Dr. Ed compares the current decade to the Roaring 1920s, citing post-pandemic recovery, technological breakthroughs, and trade conflicts. He anticipates that AI and automation will enhance productivity, fueling wage growth, economic expansion, and a reduction in the U.S. deficit-to-GDP ratio.

While he assigns a 55% probability to the ""Roaring 2020s"" scenario, he also sees a 25% chance of a melt-up, warning that excessive market exuberance could lead to a bubble. Despite risks like a debt crisis, political uncertainty, and inflation surprises, Dr. Ed remains optimistic about the market’s long-term strength.

---

### 5. U.S. Economy Shows Steady Growth, Fed May Not Need to Cut Rates Further



Dr. Ed believes the Federal Reserve does not need to lower interest rates further, arguing that the Fed’s decision to cut rates in September 2024 was a mistake, as the economy remained strong and inflation had not yet reached 2%. He deems current interest rates suitable, noting that the 4.5% yield on the 10-year Treasury aligns with historical norms for a robust economy.

Lowering rates too soon, he warns, could lead to excessive speculation in the stock market, similar to the tech bubble of 1999 and 2000, potentially causing a market crash. While the Fed’s models suggest a neutral rate of around 3%, as indicated in its quarterly summary of economic projections, Dr. Yardeni disagrees. He states that despite looking at the same data as the Fed, he does not see a compelling reason for the federal funds rate to drop all the way to 3%, emphasizing that the Fed should acknowledge economic strength rather than push for aggressive rate cuts.

---


### 6. 4.5% Treasury Yield is at a Healthy & Investable Level

Dr. Ed believes that the current 4.5% yield on U.S. Treasuries is reasonable and indicative of a strong economy, considering it a normal level similar to those before the Great Financial Crisis. He regards it as a secure and appealing option for investors prioritizing low-risk assets with competitive returns, emphasizing that U.S. Treasuries remain secure since the government will not default. Given these factors, he sees 4.5% as an appropriate and investable level in the current economic environment.

However, Dr. Ed points out that this yield remains attractive only if there are no further rate hikes and the debt crisis remains under control. While rate cuts could influence bond allocations, he does not see them as the primary driver for investment decisions. Instead, he suggests that investors consider increasing their exposure to gold as an alternative strategy.

---


### 7. AI Innovation Drives Investment and Bullish Equity Sentiment


Although it's still too early to say for sure, Dr. Ed believes that investment in A.I. will persist. As more major companies, like the Magnificent 7, invest billions of dollars in data center infrastructure, our capacity to process information grows. Deepseek has demonstrated how cost-effective and rapid A.I.-driven data processing can be. Ultimately, whether A.I. becomes the next revolutionary force is secondary. 

Dr. Ed contends that the market enthusiasm surrounding DeepSeek’s innovation will bolster a bullish outlook for U.S. equities. This view is rooted in his belief in entrepreneurial capitalism. He stated that no matter how successful a company becomes, a competitor will always emerge, finding a way to outperform DeepSeek’s approach at a lower cost. This competitive dynamic ultimately drives US companies to perform better, reinforcing the bullish outlook on US stocks.

### 8. Valuations May Be High, But Earnings Growth is Key—S&P 500 Could Reach 7,000 This Year

Dr. Ed recognizes elevated stock market valuations but cautions against a rally fueled exclusively by multiple expansion, as it could lead to a speculative ""melt-up"" scenario similar to 1999. Instead, he believes that earnings growth will be the primary driver of higher stock prices. He expects better-than-anticipated economic growth and productivity, which could push S&P 500 earnings to $285 per share this year and $320 per share in 2025. By the end of the decade, he projects earnings to reach $400 per share. Based on these forecasts, he sees the S&P 500 reaching 7,000 by the end of 2024, 8,000 by 2026, and potentially 10,000 by 2029, all fueled mainly by strong corporate earnings. Despite high valuation multiples, he asserts that robust earnings growth will underpin the market’s upward momentum.

"1094","Yardeni Research | A Tale Of Woes","a-tale-of-woes","2025-02-26","#### Executive Summary

While Ed and Eric have been accentuating the positives in the stock market outlook and also acknowledging the negatives, investors and many commentators seem suddenly to be doing the opposite. Today, Ed outlines both the concerns that dragged the stock market off its midweek record high last week and our base-case Roaring 2020s scenario (55% subjective odds). Even if a 1990s-style meltup was followed by a meltdown (25% odds), we’d expect that meltdown to be short-lived. That’s because our productivity-driven Roaring 2020s economic scenario would still be buoying corporate earnings. … Also: what we’re monitoring to assess the concerns that have weakened the market in recent days, thus focusing our attention on our “bucket list” of what could go wrong (20% odds). Check out the accompanying [chart collection](https://yardeni.com/wp-content/uploads/cc_20250224.pdf).


#### Strategy I: Accentuating the Negatives.
I was on the road again last week, speaking at the MoneyShow conference in Las Vegas and meeting with a couple of our accounts in Texas. At a client appreciation dinner for one account in Houston, I learned a lot about the oil and gas business from the folks at my table. I told them that everything I know about their business I picked up by watching the TV series Landsman, starring Billy Bob Thornton.
 
In my presentations, I accentuated the positives for the US economy and stock market while acknowledging the negatives. The S&P 500 rose to a record high of 6144.15 last Wednesday. But then it fell 2.1% during the last two days of the week to close at 6013.13, nearly back down to its 50-day moving average.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1094/bb5e37f9-194139.png)

That minor decline from the record high seemed to unleash lots of negative chatter in the financial press about what could be going wrong for the economy and the stock market. It didn’t take long to hear stock market pundits accentuating the negatives.
 
On Friday, for example, billionaire Steve Cohen, founder of Point72 Asset Management, described a bearish outlook at the Future Investment Initiative Institute’s summit in Miami Beach. He pointed to sticky inflation, slowing growth, and the possibility of retaliatory tariffs as drags on the US economy. “I’m actually pretty negative for the first time in a while,” Cohen said. “It may only last a year or so, but it’s definitely a period where I think the best gains have been had and wouldn’t surprise me to see a significant correction.” Cohen also accentuated the possible negative effects of the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
 
Such concerns have been building for the past few weeks, particularly in response to the Trump administration’s policies, which are widely viewed as chaotic and uncertainty stirring, with unclear effects on the economy and stock market. Uncertainty is often a negative for business spending, consumer sentiment, the outlook for corporate earnings, and the stock market. Is it this time too?
 
Consider the following:
 
**(1) Animal spirits vs policy uncertainty.**
The unleashing of animal spirits by the election of President Donald Trump for a second term has already been offset by “policy uncertainty” under Trump 2.0. For instance, the survey of small business owners conducted by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) shows a dramatic increase in the outlook for general business conditions. This series, which measures the percentage of better minus worse assessments soared from -5% during October 2024 to 47% during January 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1094/7bea5410-187336.png)

On the other hand, the NFIB’s uncertainty index was 100 during January, one of the highest readings of this series since it started during 1986.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1094/59782ac7-114013.png)
 
**(2) Walmart.**
The selloffs in the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday and Friday were led by an 8.9% drop in Walmart’s stock price. The company’s earnings rose to a record high during Q4-2024, but management provided cautious guidance for 2025. Given that the stock’s forward P/E had nearly doubled since September 2022, from 20 to last Wednesday’s peak of 38, it took only that whiff of a headwind to send it sliding.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1094/a156b51f-160423.png)
 
Specifically, what Walmart’s CFO John David Rainey said was that consumers’ “wallets are stretched.” But he also said that their spending remains steady. He noted that Walmart’s shoppers in Mexico seemed to be pulling back, maybe on tariff talk. Walmart will also have to pay an additional 10% tariff on goods imported from China. If the company can’t find alternative cheaper vendors for these goods elsewhere, it will have to either accept a smaller profit margin or pass the prices increases on to consumers, who might respond by buying less.
 
**(3) Consumer sentiment**
Also weighing on the stock market on Friday was the release of January’s Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) survey. It seems to be more sensitive to inflation than the Consumer Confidence Index survey, which is more sensitive to employment. In any case, the former showed a sharp decline in the overall CSI from 71.1 in January to 67.8 in February, the lowest since July 2024.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1094/54c9e799-331302.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts: [US - Consumer Confidence](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/3686/pan-duan-mei-guo-jing-qi-shi-fou-ji-jiang-shuai-tui_8122/22/consumer-confidence)*

There was a significant 12% decline in buying conditions for durable goods, partly due to concerns about the impact of tariff policies.
 
It seems many people are worried about the potential return of high inflation soon. Year-ahead inflation expectations surged from a recent low of 2.6% during November to 4.3% in February, the highest since November 2023. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1094/0070a0d3-199187.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts: [US - UMich Inflation Expectations](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/22021/mit-expected-inflation-rate)*

Interestingly, Republicans expect zero inflation, while Independents and Democrats expect 3.7% and 5.1%! This survey clearly is biased by extreme partisanship. Inflation expectations for the next five to ten years is now up to 3.5%, the highest since April 1995. The increase over the past two months has been the largest since February 2009.
 
In the past, the CSI survey’s year-ahead inflation expectations series was driven mostly by the price of gasoline.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1094/356d49f5-230949.png)

The latter has been relatively subdued recently. So the current jump in inflation expectations is probably attributable to tariff talk or maybe soaring egg prices or both.
 
**(4) Retail sales**
Retail sales fell 0.9% m/m during January.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1094/4d3fd672-99017.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts: [US - Retail Sales](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/86/retail-sales)*

That was a significant drop suggesting that consumers might be retrenching. We attribute the weakness to bad weather and to faulty seasonal adjustment. This is confirmed by the weekly Redbook retail sales series, which was up 5.8% y/y through the February 14 week.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1094/7d14dff3-226348.png)

We expect to see a strong rebound in retail sales during February and March.
 
**(5) Consumer credit & delinquencies**
Consumer credit jumped $40.8 trillion during December, one the biggest monthly gains in the history of the series.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1094/34d16e16-137773.png)

We view that as an aberration rather than an indication that consumers’ budgets are stretched. The ratio of consumer credit to disposable personal income remains relatively low.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1094/3eb8d80f-201153.png)

Alarmists are also ringing their alarm bells about delinquencies on consumer credit cards that are overdue by 90 days or more. They rose to 11.4% of credit card balances during Q4-2024.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1094/6411e8eb-191763.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts: [US - Percent of Balance 90+ Days Delinquent by Loan Type](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/9/us-market-relative/82192/us-severe-delinduency-rate)*

Furthermore, 7.2% of credit cards transitioned to such delinquency status at the end of last year.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1094/4456e094-921417.png)
Those are concerning developments, but they’re hardly alarming when compared to past experience.
 
**(6) Purchasing managers’ survey**
Another reason that the stock market sold off on Friday was the release of February’s S&P Global services PMI, which showed a steep decline from 52.9 in January to 49.7 this month.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1094/60cdedea-130402.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts: [US - ISM Non-Manufacturing Index](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/8/us-industry-relative/55/ism-nonmanu)*

We doubt that the services economy stopped growing in February. We expect that February’s ISM nonmanufacturing PMI will show a stronger reading when it is released in early March.
 
**(7) Inflation & the Fed**
Also unnerving investors last week was the jump in February’s prices-paid and prices-received indexes in the regional business surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Philadelphia.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1094/4c14ef55-219442.png)

Both were released last week. They suggest that tariff talk is already putting upward pressure on prices. If so, then the Fed’s rate-cutting will remain on pause for a while. We are already fielding questions from accounts wondering if the Fed’s next move might have to be a rate increase if inflation heats up. It's possible, but not likely.
 
We attribute the spike in these regional PMIs to tariff talk, including worrisome scenarios that we think won’t pan out. We are expecting lots of bilateral negotiations between the US and its major trading partners to lead to bringing down tariffs in a reciprocal fashion rather than to retaliatory tariff wars.
 
**(8) Valuation & Buffett**
Among the most unsettling development since early last year has been seeing Warren Buffett raising cash at Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The amount of cash and equivalents held by the firm rose to a record $334 billion at the end of last year.
 
In his [annual letter](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2024ltr.pdf?utmcampaign=Morning%20Briefing&utmsource=hsemail&utmmedium=email&utmcontent=2&hsenc=p2ANqtz-iDuDiEL4pMvGVRkCFVXXDfYjJfctKo7DJnY2zre03XtwYEepLOdElZ5CRRYS42uRuI6oeGi8VzkXVVEIZsZzX7PqA&hsmi=2) to investors, released on Saturday, the Oracle of Omaha didn’t explain why he had raised so much cash. Instead, he wrote, “Despite what some commentators currently view as an extraordinary cash position at Berkshire, the great majority of your money remains in equities. That preference won’t change. While our ownership in marketable equities moved downward last year from $354 billion to $272 billion, the value of our non-quoted controlled equities increased somewhat and remains far greater than the value of the marketable portfolio.”
 
Buffett also avoided any mention of Trump 2.0 or recent macroeconomic developments. He also didn’t comment on the stock market. We suspect that Buffett believes that the stock market is overvalued since he hasn’t found much to buy in it lately. So he decided to cash some of his gains and park the funds in Treasuries, which he did discuss at some length in his letter. He noted that Treasury bills provided a good return, which boosted Berkshire’s earnings. He proudly wrote that his company “paid far more in corporate income tax than the U.S. government had ever received from any company—even the American tech titans that commanded market values in the trillions.”
 
Walmart’s selloff last week suggests that heady valuation multiples are vulnerable to fall if investors have second thoughts about their heady assumptions for corporate earnings. The Buffett Ratio, a measure of valuation, is in record-high territory.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1094/8e7a0496-193270.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts: [US - Buffett Indicator](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/406/us-buffet-index-gspc)*

That’s probably all we need to explain why Buffett has been raising cash!
 
**(9) Time to sell? **
So why aren’t we recommending selling stocks? We are expecting that the bull market will be driven by earnings growth rather than higher valuations this year and likely through the end of the decade. We are sticking with our technology-driven, productivity-led Roaring 2020s scenario. It remains our base case, with a subjective probability of 55%.
 
We assign another 25% to a 1990s-style meltup. But unlike the meltdown that followed the meltup back then, we expect that any post-meltup meltdown will be short-lived and a great buying opportunity, because our base-case Roaring 2020s economic scenario will keep corporate earnings aloft.
 
We assign the remaining 20% subjective probability to a bucket of everything that can go wrong. These possible scenarios include a 1970s-style twin peaks in inflation. Another possible bearish outcome would be a debt crisis. And now that Trump is moving to impose tariffs, a trade war becomes a possibility.
 

#### Strategy II: Accentuating the Positives

The list of woes above seems to have hit the stock market hard during Thursday and Friday of last week. The list is mostly about developments suggesting that consumers might be retrenching because they have too much debt, inflation may be starting to erode their purchasing power again, and they are uncertain whether Trump 2.0 will or will not benefit them personally. Consider the following:
 
**(1) Jobless claims**
Economists are now watching initial unemployment claims in the area around Washington, DC as the DOGE Boys are firing federal workers in roles that they deem unnecessary. We are watching DC area unemployment too; but we will also continue to focus on the national claims data, which remained subdued through the week of February 14.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/1094/0cb15b52-147297.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts: [US - Initial & Continuing Jobless Claims](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4/us-employ-relative/19/initial-jobless-claims)*
 
**(2) Corporate earnings**
We will also be monitoring the weekly data on the forward earnings of the S&P 500, S&P 400, and S&P 600 for signs that Trump 2.0 is weighing on the earnings estimates of industry analysts. All three dipped over the past couple of weeks.

However, the forward earnings of the S&P 500 remains in record-high territory, while that of the S&P 400 remains near its previous record high in early 2022.
 
**(3) Capital spending**
Policy uncertainty might depress capital spending. Maybe. We aren’t convinced. Technology accounts for about half of capital spending. We expect that business spending on technology won’t be slowed by uncertainties about Trump 2.0. Companies need to proceed with such spending to boost their productivity and to remain competitive.
 
**(4) Reciprocal tariffs**
As noted above, we expect that Trump’s threat to impose reciprocal tariffs is likely to lead to bilateral negotiations with America’s major trading partners which should lead to lower tariffs rather than a retaliatory trade war.
 
**(5) Energy supremacy**
One of the central pillars of Trump 2.0 is to exploit America’s abundant energy resources. Last week, the Trump administration issued its first approval for exports from a new liquified natural gas (LNG) plant, which Commonwealth LNG has proposed to build in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. The Houston-based company plans to build a natural gas export terminal on 150 acres where the mouth of Calcasieu Ship Channel meets the Gulf of America. The plant would export up to 9.5 million metric tons of LNG per year—the equivalent of just over 3,700 Superdomes filled with natural gas.
 
The facility that Commonwealth LNG plans to build will be one of 16 export terminals proposed on the Gulf Coast. It’s less than a third of the size of another LNG terminal proposed to be built just across the Calcasieu Ship Channel called “CP2,” which would be the world’s largest LNG plant if constructed.

The Bond Vigilantes aren’t saddling up just yet, but they’re on high alert, Ed reports. They’re watching to see whether anti-DOGE gunslingers will cripple the new federal department or whether DOGE will root out sufficient government inefficiencies to enable Trump 2.0 to slow the budget deficit’s growth and proceed on its tax-cut plans. The stakes are high for the US economy and financial markets, as the Bond Vigilantes have never carried more firepower in their holsters. Fortunately, Treasury Security Bessent is keeping the administration mindful of that. … Also: Eric puts January’s retail sales report in sanguine perspective and discusses industrial production data suggesting a rolling recovery in US manufacturing. … Check out the accompanying [chart collection](https://yardeni.com/wp-content/uploads/cc_20250218.pdf).

#### Federal Budget I: The DOGE Boys 
“The Gunfight at Dodge City” is a 1959 Western film. After his brother the sheriff is murdered, Bat Masterson is elected to the job of sheriff and is determined to find the killer and make Dodge City safe. Today, there are gunfights going on in DOGE City to restore law and order to fiscal policy. Will the new sheriff in town get the job done, or will the Bond Vigilantes do it?
 
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk (who reminds us of a superhero on a mission to save humanity), is scrambling to uncover waste and fraud in the federal government. That should be easy. The question is whether he and his team—a.k.a. the DOGE Boys—can find enough waste and fraud to make a big difference to the federal budget outlook if eliminated.
 
The reason the boys are scrambling is that the Democrats are regrouping and coming to DOGE City for a gunfight. The Democrats have rounded up a posse of Democratic district attorneys from all around the country to stop Musk’s muckrakers by filing motions in courts to block them from raking the muck they find.
 
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent probably also alerted the DOGE Boys that the Bond Vigilantes might be coming to DOGE City for a shootout if the Trump administration doesn’t convince them there’s no need for a gunfight because the President will deliver fiscal discipline and resist telling the Fed to lower interest rates.
 
After all, the Fed did lower the federal funds rate (FFR) by 100bps from September 18 through December 18 last year, but the Bond Vigilantes immediately expressed their dismay that monetary policy was stimulating an economy that didn’t need to be stimulated and enabling fiscal excesses. They did so by pushing the bond yield higher by 100bps.

▌*View Related Live Charts: [US - Treasury Yields vs. Fed Funds Rate](https://en.macromicro.me/charts/762/us-fed-funds-rate-treasury-bonds-rate)*

In the past, the Fed lowered the FFR from cyclical peaks because the peaks were followed by recessions. There has been no recession this time.

Now, consider a few of the recent developments that led up to the trouble brewing in DOGE City:
 
**(1) Summer 2024**
Elon Musk floated the concept of DOGE in discussions with Donald Trump during the summer of 2024 as the then-former President campaigned for a second term. In an August campaign event, Trump said that, if elected, he would consider giving Musk an advisory role on how to streamline the government. Musk immediately tweeted, “I am willing to serve.”
 
**(2) October 27, 2024** 
Elon Musk first declared that DOGE would cut $2 trillion from the federal budget on October 27, 2024, during a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden. Over the 12 months through January, the federal government’s budget deficit totaled $2.14 trillion.

**(3) January 8, 2024** 
However, on January 8, 2025, Musk stated in an interview with Mark Penn that achieving the $2 trillion cut was unlikely and that the best-case outcome would be around $1 trillion. Over the past 12 months through January, federal government outlays totaled $7.1 trillion, with $6.0 trillion in mandatory outlays (including Social Security, Medicare, health, income security, national defense, and net interest). Net interest outlays alone totaled $920.6 billion, exceeding the $910.2 billion spent on defense over the last 12 months.

▌*View Related Live Charts: [US - Federal Outlays (Monthly)](https://en.macromicro.me/series/45819/us-federal-outlays-monthly)*

**(4) January 20, 2025** 
On Inauguration Day, President Trump signed an [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=347723693&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-80g2BNBSjMiFqnQ5XNWLmCtGASsnDkEHj5-mptYdvVpEUKFqBRm6JPwmUpZ4A-27Acqkf2pmedepcWmvmqMsjVKnJNjg&_hsmi=347723693) titled “Establishing and Implementing the President’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency.’” The order renamed the existing United States Digital Service “the United States DOGE Service” (USDS). Within the USDS, a new organization was established, the US DOGE Service Temporary Organization, which is headed by the USDS administrator (Musk) and is scheduled to be terminated on July 4, 2026.
 
Each government agency must establish a “DOGE Team of at least four employees, which may include Special Government Employees, hired or assigned within thirty days of the date of this Order. Agency Heads shall select the DOGE Team members in consultation with the USDS Administrator. Each DOGE Team will typically include one DOGE Team Lead, one engineer, one human resources specialist, and one attorney.”

The goal of this Executive Order is to modernize “federal technology and software to maximize efficiency and productivity.” To achieve that, the DOGE Teams will have “full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems.”
 
Needless to say, DOGE has stirred up lots of controversy in Washington. There are almost daily headlines on DOGE’s success at finding lots of inefficiencies, waste, and possible fraud within the government accounts. Many of these headlines are generated by Musk’s tweets on X.
 
There is lots of pushback by Democrats, who are challenging the legality of the DOGE Boys’ flipping through government files. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who had served as the director of the Congressional Budget Office, compared DOGE to the former Grace Commission, which had zero of its 150 proposals enacted.
 
#### Federal Budget II: In Bessent We Trust 
It’s too soon to tell how much DOGE will reduce government spending. However, Treasury Secretary Bessent is certainly aware of the need to reduce the federal budget deficit relative to nominal GDP. He has committed to halving this ratio from 6% to 3%.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/ee5bbf4f-138706.png)

This ratio was last at 3% during Q4-2015 (2.93%, to be exact). Since then, Trump 1.0 tax cuts drove it up to 4.65% during Q4-2019 (just before the pandemic), and Biden’s outlays raised it over 6% during Q4-2024.
 
Trump 2.0 is borrowing a page from the Clinton administration’s playbook, specifically the one in which Robert Rubin and James Carville warned Clinton that he had to respect the power of the Bond Vigilantes and maintain fiscal discipline. On February 6, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that he and President Trump are less concerned about the federal funds rate (FFR) and instead are hoping to contain the 10-year Treasury yield. Bessent’s message to the Bond Vigilantes was that he has explained to President Trump that they have the power to stymie his fiscal agenda.
 
However, on February 12, Trump posted the following on his Truth Social platform: “Interest Rates should be lowered, something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs!!!” That assertion flew in the face of economists’ expectations that tariffs would fuel inflation and postpone rate cuts as well as what Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told US lawmakers the day before: that the Fed was in no rush to cut its short-term interest rate again given an economy that is strong overall.

The Bond Vigilantes are biding their time, waiting to see how much the Trump administration can slow the increase in federal spending because of the efforts of the DOGE Boys. If they don’t deliver enough spending cuts, there could be a gunfight at DOGE City, with the Bond Vigilantes shooting holes in the Trump administration’s fiscal agenda, including the extension of his tax cuts.
 
It is good that Bessent understands the power of the Bond Vigilantes. In effect, he represents their interests within the Trump administration. Eric and I believe that by appointing Bessent as Treasury Secretary and establishing DOGE, Trump bought his administration some time to deal with the federal budget mess.
 
#### Federal Budget III: Tracking The Bond Vigilantes
“Bond Vigilantes” is the phrase I coined in July 1983 to refer to bond investors, acting in their own financial interests, when their activity drives up bond yields out of belief that the government will fail in its duty to keep the budget deficit from ballooning and inflation contained via fiscal and monetary policy. They’ll demand greater yield for their long-term bond investments if they think the value of their investment will be eroded by inflation over the term. Higher bond market yields effectively push up other interest rates—so it’s as if bond investors are taking fiscal and monetary discipline into their own hands, vigilante style, when the government drops the ball. (See [The Bond Vigilantes](https://archive.yardeni.com/pub/excerptbv.pdf?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=347723693&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-80g2BNBSjMiFqnQ5XNWLmCtGASsnDkEHj5-mptYdvVpEUKFqBRm6JPwmUpZ4A-27Acqkf2pmedepcWmvmqMsjVKnJNjg&_hsmi=347723693) excerpt from my 2018 book [Predicting the Markets](https://www.amazon.com/Predicting-Markets-Autobiography-Edward-Yardeni/dp/1948025000?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=347723693&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-80g2BNBSjMiFqnQ5XNWLmCtGASsnDkEHj5-mptYdvVpEUKFqBRm6JPwmUpZ4A-27Acqkf2pmedepcWmvmqMsjVKnJNjg&_hsmi=347723693).)

One way to monitor the activities of the Bond Vigilantes is to compare the 10-year Treasury bond yield to the growth in nominal GDP on a y/y basis. When the spread is positive while the economy is growing, they are doing what they can to slow it down. They were asleep at the reins during the 1960s and 1970s, when inflation got out of hand. They were much more vigilant during the 1980s and early 1990s.

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/6fa79c3c-200071.png)

The Bond Vigilantes were stymied by the Fed’s QE (quantitative easing, i.e., buying bonds) and ZIRP (i.e., zero-interest-rate policy) from 2008 through 2022, i.e., between the Great Financial Crisis and the Great Virus Crisis, when the Fed’s monetary stance was ultra easy. The bond market was rigged by the Fed during this period. The Fed tightened monetary policy by raising the FFR and ending QE from March 2022 through August 2024, allowing the bond yield to normalize.
 
The 10-year Treasury bond yield is currently about 4.50%, having risen back up to around where it was before the Great Financial Crisis (Fig. 9). The spread between the bond yield and the growth rate in nominal GDP was -70bps during Q4-2024. It remains around zero currently. Nominal GDP growth was 5.0% y/y during Q4.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/4d475a8f-150907.png)

We conclude that the Bond Vigilantes aren’t saddling up just yet to ride into DOGE City for a gunfight with the Trump administration. But ask us again if the yield jumps above 5.0% with attendant widespread fear that it is heading toward 6.0%.
 
The Bond Vigilantes have never been potentially more powerful than right now given that total federal public debt outstanding is a record $36.2 trillion with a record $28.5 trillion in marketable US Treasury securities.

#### Economy I: Seasonal Sales Issues
Retail sales fell 0.9% m/m in January, one of the worst monthly readings in years. And because of the 0.7% m/m increase in CPI goods inflation, real retail sales fell by 1.6% m/m last month. Those are ugly numbers, and they brought a few bears out of hibernation to proclaim that the long-awaited economic slowdown is here!

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/146fee0b-85881.png)

We’re not too worried about January’s one-off dip in spending; January is always a bad month for retail sales after December’s spending bonanza and before seasonal adjustment. We continue to be optimistic on the US consumer. Here’s more:
 
**(1) Smoothing out seasonals**
The Census Bureau’s seasonal adjustment is an attempt to smooth out the December surge and January plummet in spending each year. For instance, retail sales fell 16.5% m/m in January on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, a tad less than it fell in January 2024 (-16.8%) and 2022 (-17.0%) and a bit more than it fell in 2023 (-14.8%).
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/c396c26c-110700.png)

In several economic indicators, including retail sales, the seasonal adjustments haven’t fully caught up to the post-pandemic shifts in consumer behavior. January's retail sales rose 4.2% y/y on a seasonally adjusted basis and 4.8% not seasonally adjusted.
 
The Redbook retail sales series shows a solid increase of 5.3% y/y through the week of February 7, 2024 in nominal terms. It has a good correlation with the comparable growth rate for monthly retail sales excluding food services. We also note that the winter deep freeze, and perhaps the fires in California, likely weighed on consumer activity last month.

**(2) Auto regression**
After a very strong Q4, auto sales fell off in January. The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for total new-vehicle sales fell from 16.9 million units in December to 15.6 million in January. We believe auto dealers used discounts to clear out their inventories heading into the end of last year, which contributed to the big drop in Q4-2024 GDP inventory investment but also spurred a lot of sales. So in Q1, we're likely to see inventories rebuilt but sales slow a little.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/876886e5-233071.png)

Auto sales (-2.8% m/m) was the biggest overall drag on January retail sales. Sporting goods, hobby & bookstores (-4.6%) experienced the largest monthly drop off. We expect that the category also suffered from some seasonal adjustment misreads and will likely rebound next month.
 
#### Economy II: Manufacturing Mojo 
Hours worked by manufacturing employees fell by 0.7% m/m in January, which typically would suggest that industrial production fell by about the same amount. However, industrial production rose 0.5% m/m after adding 1.0% in December. We had expected the bad weather to weigh unduly on hours worked, but we thought it would be less likely to influence manufacturing. So the increase was encouraging and suggests US manufacturing may be in the first inning of its rolling recovery. The 2.0% y/y increase in production is the largest increase since the Fed began its last round of rate hikes in 2022.

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/198dff20-247696.png)

Looking deeper at the latest industrial production data, the restarting of Boeing’s production after worker strikes accounted for 0.2ppts of the total 0.5% increase, according to the Fed. Aerospace rose 6.0% m/m, while the index for utilities jumped 7.2% due to demand for heating. Utilities production continues to make new monthly highs, and the demand for data processing and new energy sources from the AI boom suggest it won’t be stopping.

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/2f4f3255-119672.png)

Autos fell 5.2% m/m, dragging on the index for manufacturing output. Given Trump 2.0 initiatives to reshore auto manufacturing, we think OEMs have enough stick and carrot to pick up production by the end of the quarter.

Early access is now open for MM Prime! Don’t miss this opportunity to stay ahead of market trends and seize your advantage!"
"1085","Trump’s America: Sweeping Executive Orders Targeting Tariffs, AI, and Immigration ","trump-s-america-sweeping-executive-orders-targeting-tariffs-ai-and-immigration","2025-02-12","Key Takeaways: 

1. **Tariffs**: Trump fired the first shot on tariffs, targeting Canada, Mexico, and China. While Canada and Mexico are more likely to compromise, allowing for a potential rollback of tariffs once Trump’s demands are met, tariffs on China are less likely to be swiftly resolved through negotiations given the ongoing tech war.  

2. **AI**: The Trump administration has moved swiftly to show strong support for AI development, positioning the government at the forefront of efforts in advancing AI expansion. Meanwhile, the arrival of DeepSeek has set a clear industry direction of making AI models more efficient and cheaper, which is expected to broaden the scope of AI beneficiaries. In the ongoing battle for tech supremacy, the U.S. will likely continue to focus on restricting China’s computing power and containing China’s countermeasures. 

3. **Energy / Immigration**: Trump’s policies for expanding oil and gas production and tightening border enforcement align with expectations. U.S. crude oil production capacity is expected to keep rising, serving as a key strategy to mitigate tariff-induced inflation. Meanwhile, immigration restrictions remain focused on border security and are thus expected to have limited impact given the currently balanced labor market.

### I. Tariffs: Trump Fires the First Shot, Aiming at Canada, Mexico, and China 

>**Related Executive Orders & Developments:** 

>1. On February 1, citing threats posed by illegal immigration and influx of drugs (especially fentanyl), Trump signed three executive orders **imposing a 10% additional tariff on imports from China and a 25% additional tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, with the exception of a lower 10% tariff on energy resources from Canada, starting on February 4.** 

>2. On the same day, both Canada and Mexico announced countermeasures. The Canadian Prime Minister declared a 25% retaliatory tariff on CAD 155 billion worth of U.S. imports, while the Mexican President stated she had directed the Minister of Economy to implement  both tariff and non-tariff measures, where, per foreign media sources, the tariff portion may involve a 5~20% retaliatory tariff on U.S. imports. On February 4, China also announced retaliatory measures, focusing on three areas: 

>* **Retaliatory tariffs**: a 10~15% additional tariff on U.S. energy products (liquified natural gas, crude oil), agricultural machinery, and large-displacement vehicles; 

>* **Critical minerals**: expanded export controls on rare earth elements, including tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum, and indium; and 

>* **U.S. companies**: launching an antitrust investigation into Google and adding PVH Corp and Illumina to China’s unreliable entity list. 

>3. After speaking with the Canadian Prime Minister and Mexican President, **Trump signed an executive order on February 3 to postpone the tariffs for 30 days (until March 4)**. Canada also postponed its counter tariffs by one month subsequently. 

>4. In addition to tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, **Trump also stated that tariffs would soon happen with the EU **, and that he intends to impose tariffs on imports of computer chips, pharmaceuticals, steel, aluminum, copper, and oil and gas, potentially as early as mid-February. 

The latest round of tariff moves reflects Trump’s “**pressure first, negotiate later**” strategy. Following discussions with Trump, Canada and Mexico have softened their stance, both expressing willingness to strengthen border security. With that, the immediate tariff threat has been defused, but the tariffs are still set to take effect in a month.  

 ---

#### 1. Tariff Impact: Greater Impact on Mexico and Canada, Limited Effect on the U.S. 

Regarding the impact of tariffs, according to estimates by the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), in a scenario where the U.S. imposes a 10% tariff on China and a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico, **the projected drag on real GDP growth of the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and China could be up to -0.33%, -1.24%, -1.97%, and -0.21%, respectively, while inflation could be pushed up by up to 0.54, 1.68, 2.27, and 0.17 percentage points, respectively.** Based on these projections, Canada and Mexico would face the greatest impact in terms of both economic contraction and inflationary pressures. 

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/f6e0078b-542675.png)

The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) forecasts that a 10% tariff would reduce China’s GDP by -0.3 percentage points from 2025 to 2027. Meanwhile, we believe that, until the president achieves his broader objectives, tariffs on China are unlikely to remain capped at 10%. Thus, the more neutral scenario may be a total of around 15~20% tariff being imposed during 2025~2027. Under this scenario, EIU estimates **the negative impact on China’s GDP could reach -0.6 percentage points.**

---

#### 2. Tariff Duration: Canada and Mexico Likely to Compromise, Raising Chances of Tariff Rollback After Trump’s Goals Are Met  

However, **the projected impact above assumes that the tariffs will remain in place permanently, so the key question is whether the tariffs will actually persist long enough for their economic impact to materialize**. As such, Trump’s true motives warrant closer examination. While reducing the trade deficit has been a central justification for his tariff policies, as the chart below suggests, Canada and Mexico, the two primary targets this time, account for a relatively small share of the U.S. trade deficit when taking into account the total trade volume involved, indicating that addressing the trade deficit may not be Trump’s primary objective this time; rather, there are other underlying goals involved.  

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/85d19f11-306465.png)

>*Note: The figures in the chart are calculated by dividing the trade deficit by total trade volume (the sum of imports and exports), representing the deficit amount by each unit of trade value with the U.S. For example, while Mexico ranks second in absolute trade deficit, its massive trade volume with the U.S. results in a relatively low ratio in the chart.* 

In fact, after Canada and Mexico expressed willingness to strengthen border controls, Trump quickly postponed the effective date of the proposed tariffs. The nations entered the negotiation stage earlier than anticipated by many. Meanwhile, Trump has repeatedly made statements urging businesses to move their production to the U.S., including in his speech at the Davos World Economic Forum (WEF) on January 23, where he stated, “Come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth...But if you don’t make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to pay a tariff.” Given these developments, our take is that **addressing illegal immigration and reviving U.S. manufacturing are the true motives of Trump’s tariff threats on Canada and Mexico.** 

Canada and Mexico’s economic structures also reflect greater dependence on exports compared to the U.S. Therefore, taking countermeasures against the U.S. will hurt their own economies even more. This is more so with the highly intertwined and integrated North American auto industry, where components cross borders multiple times before being assembled into complete vehicles. Imposing tariffs would significantly disrupt the sector, which explains why Mexico sought to exclude the auto industry from the initial stage of its retaliatory measures. Furthermore, Canada and Mexico's exports are highly dependent on the U.S. With a staggering 80% of their exports destined for the U.S., the two nations find themselves in a weak position in the negotiations. 

Given these factors, **we believe Canada and Mexico are more likely to compromise in the tariff war than China. As long as Trump gets what he wants in future negotiations (addressing immigration and bringing manufacturing back to the U.S.),  there is a strong likelihood for tariffs on Canada and Mexico to be dialed back. This underscores a key advantage for the U.S. as a major importer with strong domestic demand.**

#### 3. For China, the Tech War Remains the Core Issue 

As for the tariffs on China, there is still room for adjustments even as the tariffs take effect. Take the past List 4A and 4B tariffs as an example. Originally scheduled to take effect in 2019, tariffs on List 4A were reduced to 7.5% (from 15%) and tariffs on List B were suspended after the U.S. and China reached the Phase One trade deal in early 2020. **Based on historical experience, whether the U.S. and China can reach similar agreements will depend on the extent of concessions from China.** 

To revisit Trump’s Section 301 investigation against China in 2017, the core accusations included: 

* Forced technology transfers from U.S. companies operating in China 

* Government policies supporting systematic investment in U.S. companies by Chinese companies to obtain cutting-edge technologies 

* Unfair subsidies to strategic industries and state-owned enterprises domestically 

Therefore, the trade war can be seen as a bargaining chip the U.S. is using in the tech war, with the goal to safeguard its long-standing tech dominance. However, **compared to Mexico and Canada, China is far less dependent on the U.S. economy, and ultimately, the key friction between the two nations still comes down to technological competition, an issue that is more far-reaching and difficult to resolve. Therefore, we believe it will be much harder for the U.S. and China to swiftly reach an agreement to suspend or lift tariffs like what happened with Mexico and Canada.** Only if China agrees to end the series of unfair tech competition practices and open its market to American agricultural and energy products to a reasonable degree to demonstrate goodwill, will there be a possibility for the trade war to ease. Both sides are expected to introduce more policies and measures, especially in the tech area. With that, in the next section, let’s look at the policies Trump has introduced in the field of AI since his inauguration.

### II. AI: Strong Support for AI Development from Trump Administration, Tech War Intensifies While Productivity Also Advances 

>**Related Executive Orders & Developments:** 

>1. **Biden's 2023 executive order on addressing AI risks revoked**: The order aimed to ensure AI development adhered to certain safety standards, so as to reduce the risks AI poses to consumers, workers, national security, the economy, and public health. Trump believed the executive order would hinder AI innovation in the U.S. and had thus signed an executive order on January 20 to rescind it. 

>2. **Stargate Project**: On January 21, Trump announced the Stargate Project, a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank that plans to invest up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure over the next four years, with a goal to build 20 AI data centers and create over 100,000 jobs in the U.S. 

>3. **Artificial Intelligence Action Plan**: On January 23, Trump signed an executive order directing the development of an AI Action Plan within 180 days, with the goal to sustain and enhance the U.S.’ leading position in AI and make America the AI capital of the world. 

---

#### 1. Government Takes the Lead in Strengthening AI Development, Infrastructure Set to Benefit from Investments 

Trump took bold actions to support AI development immediately after taking office, signaling the U.S.’ determination to assert itself in the ongoing tech race. This will also bolster the development of AI models and increase demand for AI across American companies, which helped alleviate market concerns over excessive optimism in AI investments following DeepSeek’s unexpected debut in late February. **The Stargate Project and the Artificial Intelligence Action Plan have defined the trend of government-led AI investments in the U.S. over the next four years, which will also support the demand for AI infrastructure.** Meanwhile, recent earnings reports show that tech giants remain optimistic about AI’s potential, with capital expenditures in AI reaching new highs. This also means supply chains related to AI infrastructure, including AI chips, memory and storage, cooling technologies, and server manufacturing, will continue to benefit from investments.

#### 2. AI Trend Accelerates, Proportion of Companies Willing to Use AI Continues to Rise 

Looking at the data published bi-weekly in the chart below, the percentage of companies already using AI has reached a new high of 6.7% (prev. 6%), and the percentage of companies expressing willingness to use AI remains at a high level of 9.4% (prev. 9.5%). Echoing our view in [this month’s CEO House View](https://en.macromicro.me/blog/ceo-house-view-will-deepseek-or-trump-s-tariffs-derail-market-momentum), despite market concerns, DeepSeek’s impact on the AI sector is likely to be disruptive in the short-term but with long-term upside. The arrival of DeepSeek has confirmed the trend of optimizing AI model efficiency and reducing costs, which is a major positive for the broader tech sector. Based on the Jevons Paradox, **as AI technology matures and becomes cheaper, the benefits will spread to related sectors that integrate AI models to their services, such as AI smartphones, AI PCs, AI software providers, and businesses leveraging AI tools in other industries**. Coupled with policy deregulation in the field, demand for computing power will also expand significantly across nations. 

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/e8070142-315646.png)

Coming back to the U.S.-China tech war, **the U.S. is expected to remain focused on limiting China's computing power and containing China’s countermeasures**. Recently, sources suggested that the U.S. is discussing the possibility of restricting the sale of H20 chips to China. Market participants can keep an eye on acts of escalation from the U.S., including: 

1. **Expanding trade restrictions**: In addition to placing H20 and other AI chips under export controls, with a Section 301 investigation into China’s mature semiconductor manufacturing launched last December, related products may also face tariffs or import bans once the investigation concludes. 

2. **Addressing circumvention of export restrictions on chips**: In the past, China would bypass U.S. export controls by obtaining chips from third-party buyers in countries like Singapore. The Trump administration may tighten controls over these gray markets with tactics similar to the tariff actions on Canada and Mexico that serve as a negotiation tool. 

3. **Bolstering alliances against China’s countermeasures in strategic metals**: In the process of tightening chip controls, China is also expected to retaliate. As discussed in our [2025 Economic Outlook series](這篇好像沒有英文版?再請斟酌調整), China may use its control over metals critical to the semiconductor and new energy industries as leverage. In fact, in the countermeasures announced on February 4, China indeed expanded its export controls on rare earth elements, including tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum, and indium. As such, the U.S. is expected to accelerate efforts in building mineral supply chain alliances to safeguard access to critical minerals. 

>*Note: The H20, H100, H200, H800 chips are entry-level AI GPUs based on Nvidia’s Hopper GPU architecture (launched in 2022). The H20 is a China-specific chip designed to comply with ongoing U.S. export control regulations. It is a low-end version of the H800 (which has been banned for export to China), with its computing power only 20% that of the H100. DeepSeek also uses Nvidia chips for AI model training, making H20 a potential target in the next round of export restrictions.*

### III. Energy & Immigration: US to Ramp Up Oil & Gas Production and Border Security Enforcement  

>**Energy-Related Executive Orders & Developments:** 

>1. **Trump declared a national energy emergency aiming to increase domestic energy production**, including accelerating energy infrastructure development, facilitating energy refining and transportation, promoting exploration and production on federal lands and waters, and fully utilizing natural resources in Alaska. 

>2. **Trump revoked multiple Biden-era executive orders that supported clean energy development and restricted traditional energy production.** 

>3. Beyond executive orders, in his speech at the Davos WEF, Trump also stated that he would **ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to lower oil prices**. 

> 

>**Immigration-Related Executive Orders & Developments:** 

>1. **Trump also declared a national emergency at the southern border, authorizing the deployment of armed forces to the border** and clarifying the protection of U.S. sovereignty and territorial integrity at the borders as a formal military priority. 

>2. The new administration called for faithful enforcement of immigration laws against all inadmissible and deportable immigrants, while also **suspending the refugee resettlement program.** 

> 3. The administration also announced plans to **end the Biden-era “catch and release” policy, continue to build the wall along the southern border, and to reinstate the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy.** 

>4. The president also signed an executive order to end birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants and temporary visa holders. 

#### Energy & Immigration Policies Align with Expectations, Two Indicators to Watch Going Forward 

In contrast to the uncertainty surrounding tariff polices, Trump’s moves to expand traditional energy production and tighten immigration enforcement are largely in line with our expectations. 

Going forward, we recommend keeping an eye on two key indicators: (1) [U.S. crude oil production](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/19/mm-oil-price/181/us-oil-demand-supply): **U.S. crude oil output is expected to further increase under the Trump administration, which could help ease oil prices and curb inflation. This is also the core strategy Trump has relied on to counter tariff-driven inflation concerns**; (2) [Immigrant labor force participation](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4/us-employ-relative/100570/us-labor-supply-key-data): As we’ve discussed in [this article](https://en.macromicro.me/blog/2025-outlook-series-us-economic-outlook-what-s-next-for-the-us-economy-in-2025), **Trump is more likely to tighten border control and restrict new inflows of immigrants, rather than significantly ramp up deportations of those already residing in the U.S. And this seems to be the case so far.** Currently, labor force participation of immigrants is still well above pre-pandemic levels, and as long as it stays elevated without a sharp decline, the economic impact of immigration policies should be limited given the currently well-balanced labor market. (For more analysis related to immigration policy, check out our [2025 U.S. Economic Outlook article](https://en.macromicro.me/blog/2025-outlook-series-us-economic-outlook-what-s-next-for-the-us-economy-in-2025)). 

**As for the termination of birthright citizenship, which may have a greater impact in the long run, it is highly improbable for the proposed termination to be put into practice, given that birthright citizenship is a constitutionally protected right in the U.S.** This is also why, following Trump’s executive order on January 20, multiple states immediately filed lawsuits against it, and on January 23, a federal judge ruled the order as “clearly unconstitutional” and blocked the order by issuing a 14-day preliminary injunction, which can be extended upon expiration. If the court ultimately rules that birthright citizenship is constitutionally protected right, the only way to end it would be through a constitutional amendment, and the threshold for constitutional amendment is extremely high, making its passage highly unlikely.

### MM Research Insights 

In less than four weeks into his presidency, Trump has issued a series of executive orders across various fronts, stirring market volatility. However, on tariffs, which remain the biggest source of market anxiety, so far things have unfolded in the back-and-forth manner as we expected, with the Trump administration employing a combination of hardline actions and diplomatic negotiations, and with alternative motives in play. If the underlying objectives are met, the tariffs could be rolled back. And given America’s role as a major driver of global demand, Trump is in a stronger position in the tariff war compared to other nations. Coupled with immigration and energy policies largely unfolding as expected, **our outlook on the U.S. economy and inflation remains unchanged, and under the currently manageable macro conditions, no return to rate hikes by the Fed this year remain our baseline scenario** (more thoughts on Fed policy can be found in this month’s CEO house view [here](https://en.macromicro.me/blog/ceo-house-view-will-deepseek-or-trump-s-tariffs-derail-market-momentum)). Overall, liquidity conditions and economic fundamentals are expected to continue to support the U.S. equity market. 

On the U.S.-China tech war, the emergence of DeepSeek could intensify ongoing tensions and competition between the two sides. And as AI costs decline, the sector is moving closer to the third stage of software-hardware integration. **The beneficiaries are also expected to expand from a handful of tech giants to a broader range of companies, which is also in line with our projection that the gap in profit growth between U.S. companies and industry giants will begin to narrow this year. Instead of concentrated in just a few sectors, all 11 GICS sectors are now expected to see positive EPS growth in 2025.**

"1083","Yardeni Research | Anatomy Of Full Employment","anatomy-of-full-employment","2025-02-12","#### Executive Summary 
When others saw labor market weakening last summer, we saw normalization from the settling down of pandemic-period churn. Our labor market outlook remains constructive. The growth of the labor force should continue to slow, but demand for workers will remain strong, keeping the labor market needle at full employment. Strong productivity gains from widespread AI adoption and a full-employment labor market should spur robust real wage growth. Strong wage growth should keep consumer spending growth and GDP growth strong. All this should keep our Roaring 2020s economic scenario on track. Indeed, January’s labor market data confirm every aspect of our outlook. … Check out the accompanying [chart collection](https://yardeni.com/wp-content/uploads/cc_20250210.pdf).

#### Labor Market I: Finding Full Employment 
Friday’s January employment report confirms every part of our optimistic outlook on the labor market. The unemployment rate fell to 4.0%, its lowest since last May, even though more Americans decided to participate in the labor force. Before we discuss the January data, let’s review our labor market outlook.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/a0e61182-202434.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts: [US - Unemployment Rate](https://en.macromicro.me/series/37/unemployment-rate)*


As we’ve argued since last summer, the post-pandemic period was historically anomalous and led many to misread an apparent slowdown in the jobs market as harbingering a looming recession. In fact, the largest wave of immigration on record helped raise the unemployment rate without any material layoffs. Also, labor market indicators such as hiring and quits fell. Such cooling has preceded recessions in the past, but this time it was simply the natural result of the pandemic’s massive labor market churn settling down. Normalization was to be expected, but it was widely misinterpreted as a sign that the “long and variable lags” of a Federal Reserve tightening cycle finally had clamped down on the economy.
 
The labor market is likely to chart a slightly different path going forward than it did over 2023 and 2024. Greatly reduced immigration and mostly topped-out labor force participation and employment metrics from native-born workers mean that the labor force will grow at a slower pace. However, we believe demand for workers is stronger than most do. Thus, we think it is likely that the unemployment rate will remain at full employment around 3.7% to 4.3%.
 
Barring unexpected events, we’re expecting monthly payroll growth to average around 150,000-175,000 workers over the coming quarters and years, below the roughly 175,000-180,000 average pace just before the pandemic. Despite the slowdown of employment growth, strong productivity gains and a full-employment labor market should spur robust real wage growth.

This should maintain the solid pace of consumer spending growth and real GDP growth. Furthermore, consumer spending should continue to get a boost from rising nonlabor income, including interest and dividends. In addition, retiring Baby Boomers will continue to spend their retirement funds, which may very well cause the personal saving rate to turn negative.
 
Now let’s assess the implications of the January data for the remainder of this year—and consider the outlook for the rest of President Trump’s second term:
 
**(1) Payroll growth** 
Despite January’s lower-than-expected payroll gain of 143,000, the three-month average monthly increase in payrolls reached 237,000, as November’s and December’s initial figures were revised up by a collective 100,000. At the end of last year, we had an above-consensus forecast that the three-month average would be at least 200,000 after the January report. In fact, were it not for the Los Angeles fires, it might even have topped 250,000.

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/7c6943ec-793763.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts: [US - Nonfarm Payrolls](https://en.macromicro.me/series/42/nonfarm-payrolls), [US - Nonfarm Payrolls (Monthly Change)](https://en.macromicro.me/series/43/nonfarm-payrolls-monthlychange)*

Roughly 591,000 workers weren’t at work in January due to bad weather, the highest monthly total since February 2021 (when winter storms blanketed the country and led to the Texas freeze and power crisis). Based on the increase in California’s jobless claims over the past few weeks, this was likely due to the multiple weeks of LA fires—despite the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) specious declaration that the fires had no impact on employment. That seems to be the BLS’ go-to response to seemingly all extreme weather events whether it’s the case or not. But we suspect the fires had at least some impact on payroll growth because of the significant drop in average weekly hours worked to the lowest since the pandemic. This series should rebound sharply in February.

**(2) Labor market reacceleration**
The labor market may be picking up, as it has been doing since last November’s Election Day. Exhibit A is that the birth/death adjustment provided a boost to January’s payrolls gains, and we expect it will continue to so, as business applications are rising due to Trump 2.0 business optimism, a.k.a. Animal Spirits (Fig. 5). Exhibit B is that the percentage of private industries reporting high payrolls over the past three months (a.k.a. the payroll diffusion index) surged to 64.8%, the highest since January 2023 (Fig. 6).

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/a326f511-226126.png)

**(3) Goods gaining ground? **
Dragging on payroll employment have been the goods-producing sectors, i.e., mining, lodging, construction, and manufacturing. Even as construction employment has climbed to new highs, overall goods employment has stagnated and even fallen over the past few years. However, we’re expecting a turnaround as manufacturing enters a rolling recovery.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/15ee5979-176009.png)

The ISM M-PMI rose above 50.0 in January after 26 months in contraction, propelled by strong new orders, expanding employment, and higher production (Fig. 8). The payroll diffusion index for manufacturing industries also surged to a multiyear high, of 57.6% (Fig. 9).

![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/ecd91739-324362.png)

Demand for labor in goods industries ostensibly is increasing. But the growth in labor supply is undoubtedly starting to wane. New unskilled immigrants find much of their work in goods-producing sectors. Southern border crossings have plummeted since last summer and are very likely to remain low under the current administration. So over-the-table hiring (that is recorded by government statistics) is likely to accelerate. Over a longer-term horizon, if Trump 2.0 succeeds in its goals of rebalancing global trade, domestic manufacturing employment should increase as well. A lower US corporate tax rate plus tariffed foreign goods should make producing in the US more cost-competitive despite the higher cost of employing American workers.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/f78114e3-84092.png)

**(4) Leaving, not losing**
The number of workers who were unemployed due to layoffs fell in January, while the number of job leavers rose. Workers reentering the labor market, currently the largest source of unemployment, also increased. On balance, these conditions helped to boost the employment-population ratio for prime-age (25-54 years) workers to a historically high 80.7%.

If you want a job, you can find one: While it started taking longer for unemployed workers to find jobs, January’s duration of unemployment fell for those seeking jobs for the longest time periods.

And if you have a job, you’re in good shape: The number of employed workers losing their job remained at one of the lowest rates on record in January.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/e548841b-639470.png)

**(5) Not so bad for natives** 
The fact that foreign-born workers have made up most of the employment gains since the pandemic has roused some concerns about the state of the labor market. We believe that to be misleading without proper context. While native-born employment has remained relatively steady post-pandemic, plenty of native-born workers have entered the labor market and/or found news jobs. However, these additions have largely been offset on a net basis by the wave of retirements, masking the actual increase, which is evident from the boom in payroll growth. Moreover, foreign-born workers account for only about a fifth of US employment, so a small absolute increase in their ranks (from around 27,000 to 31,000) represents a large percentage change, which can sound alarming.

**(6) Revisions are a non-event**
The final revision of the BLS’s [Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages](https://www.bls.gov/cew/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--sFbzvC6H76NsvBYJ9_8CrK1n_K2wx0LVN0ZAdzaB4EKbTR9ZKniYM0JrqaZjNU6G2EEJ18tyxCaf4-UuWGFd1mZ65BQ&_hsmi=2) (QQCEW) reduced the initial downward revision for the period from April 2023 to March 2024 from -818,000 payrolls to -598,000. Also included in the January data were the Census Bureau’s update, which found that several million more immigrants came into the US over the past two years than initially estimated. Even after the big update to the size of the labor force, demand for labor continues to outstrip supply. 
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/57dab5c4-153860.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts: [US - Civilian Labor Force](https://en.macromicro.me/series/5891/us-civilian-labor-force), [US - Job Openings - Total Nonfarm](https://en.macromicro.me/series/534/job-openings-total-private)*


The large upward revision in the labor force and household employment, to 170.7 million and 163.9 million Americans respectively, will likely correlate with upward revisions to real GDP growth, business output, and therefore productivity growth. 

**(7) Average hourly earnings**
Wage growth beat expectations in January. Average hourly earnings increased 0.5% m/m and 4.1% y/y, and it increased 4.2% y/y for production and nonsupervisory workers. While we believe nominal wages growth will continue to outpace inflation, we think annual raises boosted the data. We’re expecting a gradual slowing in the y/y figure as it converges toward the Employment Cost Index, which is currently up 3.6% y/y.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/8097ce9c-185006.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts: [US - Employment Cost Index](https://en.macromicro.me/series/289/employment-cost)*

The jump in wage growth was offset by the drop in the average workweek in our Earned Income Proxy (EIP). Combined with the added 143,000 payrolls, our EIP rose 0.27% m/m in January. Typically, this would lead to an increase in retail sales by around the same amount, or less than 0.1% m/m in real terms. However, we wouldn't be surprised if consumer spending was a bit higher than that last month, as the fires in California may have boosted demand for services in the short run. In any case, we expect a rebound in consumer spending this month.

#### Labor Market II: Counting on Productivity 
We believe productivity growth is on its way up from the cyclical lows of just 0.5% in 2015 to 3.5%-4.0% annually by the end of the decade. And that’s on an annualized 20-quarter moving average basis, meaning that productivity growth is accelerating now since this figure rose to 1.8% during Q4-2024.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/1dd0bf1d-198624.png)

As population and labor force growth wanes, productivity will be the source of real economic growth. Indeed, productivity is highly correlated with real wage growth because in a competitive labor market, workers are paid their fair wage in real terms. So with the economy potentially settling in at full employment, more productive and better paid workers will drive rising consumer spending going forward. Here’s more:

**(1) Not more labor, but more productive labor** 
Productivity increases when workers produce more output for every hour they work. That productivity rate times the total number of hours worked equals real GDP growth. However, the rate of growth for aggregate weekly hours has slowed, and we wouldn’t be surprised if it slows even further through the end of the decade. Fewer new employees and shorter workweeks will become the norm.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/357d1b09-122824.png)

**(2) Productivity and labor costs** 
Productivity growth declined from 2.1% to 1.6% y/y in Q4, while unit labor costs (ULC) increased from 2.2% to 2.7% y/y. Both represent changes in direction due to a big decline in durable manufacturing output amid higher hourly compensation.
 
We expect the trends in both (i.e., higher productivity growth, lower ULC inflation) to resume this quarter. Falling auto inventories and stalled auto production dragged down real GDP growth last quarter. As the latest labor force revisions are factored into growth data, we expect an upward revision to output to raise productivity growth and lower ULC inflation. Nonetheless, manufacturing productivity appears to be growing for the first time since the Great Financial Crisis.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/3d552b73-182467.png)

**(3) Investing in capital** 
An economy at full employment means it is difficult and costly to hire new workers, so businesses are encouraged to invest in technologies to augment their workforce. Entrepreneurship also encourages productivity, and we’ve seen a boon in new business creation since the pandemic. In our opinion, the normalized-interest-rate environment makes it difficult for so-called zombie companies to stick around and artificially boost capacity, instead inspiring actual innovation. Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler highlighted both of these as factors driving the productivity boom in a [speech](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm?utm_campaign=Morning%20Briefing&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=2&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--sFbzvC6H76NsvBYJ9_8CrK1n_K2wx0LVN0ZAdzaB4EKbTR9ZKniYM0JrqaZjNU6G2EEJ18tyxCaf4-UuWGFd1mZ65BQ&_hsmi=2) on Friday.

The latest technological innovation is artificial intelligence. AI is much more likely to creatively disrupt services-providing and white-collar employment than production and supervisory workers, in our opinion. But because there is a shortage of highly skilled labor, this innovation will do more to alleviate labor cost pressures for employers and to benefit employees by making them more productive than it will to eliminate jobs and create an oversupply of workers. Indeed, we’re optimistic that AI will create more jobs than it displaces, or at least not raise the unemployment rate. In our base-case productivity-led Roaring 2020s scenario, American workers and consumers will prosper to a degree they haven’t in decades.

"1080","CEO House View | Will DeepSeek or Trump’s Tariffs Derail Market Momentum? ","ceo-house-view-will-deepseek-or-trump-s-tariffs-derail-market-momentum","2025-02-05","Dear all, 

Global stock markets largely held steady over the past few weeks, with the exception of tech stocks, which faced a pullback triggered by DeepSeek (particularly impacted was the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which fell by 8.3%). Overall, January was a positive month for equities, with most indices posting gains: the S&P 500, Dow Jones, European stock indices, and the Taiwanese stock market all registered impressive gains of over 2~9%. Despite volatility during the Lunar New Year break, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index and Nasdaq still managed to close the month with gains of +0.7% and +1.6%, respectively. In other asset classes, the U.S. dollar and Treasury yields ended the month flat. Oil prices remained relatively weak, with WTI crude consolidating around $73 per barrel, while gold reached an all-time high, breaking above $2,830 per ounce. 

**Based on the recent releases of key economic data and policies under Trump 2.0, we summarize trends in four key aspects and our thoughts below:** 

---

#### 1. Economic Fundamentals: Data Confirms Moderate Growth, Good for Sustaining Market Momentum 

On January 30, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that U.S. GDP grew at an [annualized rate](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/2/us-gdp-relative) of 2.3% in Q4 2024 (down from 3.1% in the previous quarter). Although GDP growth slowed, the GDP report actually underscores the health of the U.S. economy. Firstly, consumer spending expanded at a robust pace of 4.2%. Also, changes in inventories recorded a negative contribution of -0.93 percentage points to change in real GDP (suggesting inventories have been depleting). Therefore, although headline GDP growth was down from the previous quarter, a closer look at the details points to the strength of the economy reflected in diminishing inventories. 

>Strong GDP performance from the U.S., combined with encouraging data from other economies released recently—such as the Eurozone’s Q4 2024 [GDP growth](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/35/eu-gdp-relative) of 0.9% (same as the previous quarter), Japan’s solid growth of 3.7% in [retail sales](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/50/jp-consumption-relative) in December (prev. 2.8%), and Taiwan’s Q4 2024 [GDP growth](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/11/tw-gdp-relative/98/tw-real-gdp) of 1.84% (down from 4.17% in the previous quarter, mainly due to the surge in imports by 18% and thus not a cause of concern)—suggests a positive global economic backdrop. **Overall, economies across the world delivered solid performance in January, suggesting global economic fundamentals remain supportive, with little risk of weighing on stock market performance.**

#### 2. Liquidity Environment: Fed Holds Rates as Expected, While ECB and Bank of Canada Continue Easing 

On January 29 and 30, the [Bank of Canada](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/400/mm-cad/4331/ca-overnight-interest-rate) and the [European Central Bank (ECB)](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/43/eu-market-relative/525/eu-ecb-benchmark-interest-rate) each lowered interest rates by 25 basis points. Meanwhile, on January 30, at the [Fed’s](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4238/us-federal) first policy meeting this year, all committee members voted unanimously to keep the benchmark interest rate steady at 4.25~4.50%. In the FOMC statement, the previous language that the unemployment rate had “moved up” was removed and replaced with “unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months.” Also, the line about progress made on inflation was removed altogether, with the Fed now describing inflation as remaining “somewhat elevated.” During the post-meeting press conference, Fed chairman Powell stated that, with policy being significantly less restrictive than before and the economy remaining strong, there is no hurry to adjust policy stance at this time. 

>The meeting outcome aligns with our previous expectations—given stable economic growth, there’s no need for the Fed to rush into any immediate action at the moment. Meanwhile, released on January 31, [core PCE inflation](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/5/us-price-relative/25/pce-price) eased slightly to 2.79% in December (prev. 2.82%). Given the high base effect in the first half of the year, we anticipate continued easing in inflation, which will help ensure a favorable liquidity environment.

#### 3. Corporate Earnings: 77% of US Companies Beat Forecasts, [S&P 500 EPS](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4393/sp500-eps-collection/50507/us-sp500-sector-annual-eps-yoy) Expected to Grow by Double Digits This Year 

As of the end of January, more than 35% of S&P 500 companies have reported their Q4 2024 earnings, with approximately 77% beating market expectations. According to S&P Global, the estimated year-on-year EPS growth for the S&P 500 is +13.5% in Q4 2024 (prev. 13.2%). In addition to reaching a new record high in earnings, this also marks the first time since 2021 that Q4 EPS has achieved double-digit growth. Furthermore, overall S&P 500 earnings are forecasted to grow at a double-digit 16.19% in 2025, outpacing the 9.26% growth in 2024! 

>So far, there have been no big surprises from the earnings season in the U.S., while the recent DeepSeek developments served as a reminder of the transformative impact of the productivity cycle. As I mentioned in our 2025 Outlook Report,  the next phase of AI development hinges on two pending breakthroughs: advancements in hardware-software integration and reduction of costs. If barriers to AI adoption can be lowered through reduced costs, it could stimulate expansion across more use cases and spur demand for hardware upgrades. **The broadening out of competitive advantages from major players holding key resources is also happening faster than we imagined, a trend that will likely be reflected in this year’s earnings reports, transitioning from benefiting only a few leading tech firms to a more widespread uplift.** 
>Based on our estimates, net profit growth of the Magnificent Seven (M7) is expected to remain strong at 16~22% from Q4 2024 through Q4 2025. That said, it’s worth noting that **the other 493 companies in the S&P 500, whose profit growth had significantly lagged the M7 over the past 6 quarters, are poised to narrow that gap in 2025. All 11 GICS sectors are also projected to see positive EPS growth in 2025 (compared to just 9 sectors in 2024).**

#### 4. US Policy Landscape: Trump's Policies in Line with Expectations, No Major Surprises 

Upon his inauguration on January 20, Trump signed a total of 26 executive orders, including strict measures to curb illegal immigration and measures to expand traditional energy production. The president also revoked 78 executive orders from the Biden era, swiftly implementing his campaign promises. On tariffs, Trump signed an executive order on February 1, imposing a 25% tariff on goods imported from Canada and Mexico, and a 10% tariff on goods from China starting February 4, primarily aimed at tackling issues like fentanyl smuggling and illegal immigration. 

>Trump's actions so far have not gone beyond what was expected. Most measures echoed statements he made before taking office. Our research team will also be releasing more analysis to share our take on these policies measures. I also shared our thoughts on various Trump policies in our 2025 Outlook Report, including the assessment that tariffs can be seen as a political negotiation tactic (such as this time to deal with illegal immigrant and drug trafficking), and this approach is not new—for the past 8 years, the previous administrations also employed a combination of hardline actions and diplomatic negotiations. With an understanding of the underlying motives behind Trump’s actions, it becomes clear that their impact on the U.S. economy may not be as significant as some might think. **Whether through boosting domestic oil production to lower oil prices or capitalizing on China’s deflation to ease inflation at home, these are all part of Trump’s strategy to keep inflation in check while pursuing his ""Make America Great Again"" vision.** 

--- 

### Market Outlook and Allocation Strategy 

In summary, whether from the perspective of economic fundamentals, liquidity conditions, or corporate earnings, both the U.S. economy and the global economy have had a good start in 2025, with the main source of uncertainty still revolving around Trump’s policies. We still believe that Trump’s actions are driven by political purposes, and their impact on the U.S. economy may not be as detrimental as market discussions suggest. **In the context of the ongoing deglobalization trend, we remain bullish on three key trends in 2025: (1) growth of the U.S., Taiwan, and Indian economies driven by domestic demand and tech advantages, (2) gold’s comeback, and (3) the resilience of the defense sector. These will be the investment themes of our focus this year.** 

I hope this monthly report provides some reassurance as we move through the market volatility that unfolded during the Lunar New Year break. **We also invite you to revisit our 2025 Market Outlook report**, which highlights many of the key trends and themes to help enhance the thinking and underlying logic behind your investments, helping you stay grounded amid market fluctuations. Finally, I would also like to wish everyone a healthy and prosperous 2025! 

Cheers,

"1079","Yardeni Research | Anatomy Of Gross National Product","anatomy-of-gross-national-product","2025-02-05","#### Executive Summary
Why is the US economy so strong? Look in the mirror: The consumer is the engine of growth. Yes, technological advancements will continue to buoy GDP, as will Trump 2.0 deregulation and lower taxes. But consumer spending accounts for nearly 70% of real GDP. We reject the notion that consumer spending will slow in the face of depleted saving and other drags; it’s too resilient, which is why the economy is so resilient. Likewise, we don’t expect capital spending to slow notwithstanding a weak Q4; companies still have much to gain from investments in AI and other technological innovations. That’s the linchpin of our productivity-led Roaring 2020s outlook (55% odds) and higher S&P 500 price targets for the rest of the decade. … Check out the accompanying [chart collection](https://yardeni.com/wp-content/uploads/cc_20250203.pdf).

#### US Economy I: The Year of the Consumer
The American economy put up impressive numbers in 2024. Much of the financial media chatter has focused on the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and Trump 2.0. But lost in hullabaloo is the fact that the US consumer is powering the economy to new heights. We expect that the consumer will continue to do so in 2025.
 
We are big believers that improvements in automation, robotics, and data processing (i.e., AI and quantum computing) will continue to boost worker productivity, alleviate high-skilled labor shortages, and stimulate capital spending. We are also Trump 2.0 bulls, expecting deregulation and lower taxes to fuel more domestic investment, hiring, and consumption.
 
However, the strength of the consumer is the engine of economic growth. Indeed, personal consumption expenditures on goods (21.4%) and services (46.8%) make up 68.2% of US nominal GDP.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/4055be9d-1008396.png)

Many hard-landers who had been calling for a recession over the past three years have thrown in the towel. But even more people now seem to be expecting an economic slowdown this year. The pervasive pessimism hinges on the consumer, specifically the prospect that consumer spending will slow as the result of weakening hiring, rising consumer credit delinquencies, depleted saving, and perhaps deportations.
 
Even if the consumer doesn’t buckle, Trump 2.0 trade wars might cause a recession after all. US export industries might suffer as America’s trading partners retaliate. American consumers and businesses will have to pay more for imported goods, parts, and materials. Tariffs are taxes, which could depress economic growth. But considering that the economy withstood the most rapid Federal Reserve tightening cycle in four decades without a slowdown, we are optimistic about its resilience to shocks.
 
Our base-case outlook remains our technology-driven, productivity-led Roaring 2020s scenario, with a 55% subjective probability. As a result, it’s more than likely that the current bull market in stocks is not nearing its final inning, nor even the seventh inning stretch. Our S&P 500 price targets of 7000 by year-end 2025, 8000 by the end of 2026, and 10,000 by the end of the decade remain intact.

Here's more on the sources of last year’s GDP growth and what we expect this year:
 
**(1) New records**
Last year, real GDP rose 2.8% to yet another record high of $23.5 trillion (saar), increasing 2.3% q/q (saar) in Q4. The quarterly slowdown in headline GDP growth from Q3’s 3.1% was largely due to volatile inventory investment. Importantly, real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose to a new record high, reaching $16.3 trillion after growing 4.2% (saar) in Q4 and 2.8% for the whole of 2024. That was the highest quarterly growth since Q1-2023 and up from 1.9% in Q1-2024. Real consumer spending on both goods and services rose to record highs last quarter.

**(2) Goods boom**
Real consumer spending on goods jumped 6.6% q/q (saar) during Q4, led by a 12.1% leap in durable goods purchases. Perhaps some of the increase stemmed from consumers’ front-running potential tariffs. More likely, it was driven by year-end incentives that boosted auto sales. However, we note that durable goods consumption had been accelerating throughout the year. After falling 1.8% in Q1, real durable goods PCE increased 5.5%, 7.6%, and 6.6% in Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively, to a new record high.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/81b017b7-132747.png)

Demand for goods, especially durables like autos and appliances, surged during the pandemic. So consumer demand that goods producers normally would have seen in 2022 and 2023 was pulled forward into 2020 and 2021. But consumers were back buying briskly during 2024 despite higher interest rates. This is one sign that higher-for-longer (or, in our view, normal-for-longer) interest rates won’t slow consumers’ purchasing of big-ticket items.
 
One tailwind for goods consumption has been deflation. PCED durable goods prices fell 1.1% y/y in December and have been falling since June 2023. However, nondurables prices are starting to increase, and durable goods prices are likely to follow. That's even before the Trump administration’s tariffs take effect. Goods inflation will weigh on inflation-adjusted real consumption. The question is how much rising prices impact demand. As of now, we aren’t expecting overall demand to decrease meaningfully. Still, a negative hit to growth from trade wars is in our “what could go wrong” bucket, to which we currently assign a 20% subjective probability.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/7e2227d6-252512.png)

**(3) Incomes rising on all cylinders**
Driving consumer spending has been real income growth. In December, disposable personal income (DPI) rose 5.0% y/y to a new record high of $22.1 trillion (saar). In real terms, DPI rose 2.4% y/y in December and has been increasing at roughly its pre-pandemic pace, if not a bit faster.

The historically tight labor market and rising productivity have fueled real wage gains, particularly for lower-wage workers, who represent roughly four-fifths of US employment. Their nominal wage gains have been outpacing inflation for nearly two years after stagnating for much of the early-to-mid 2010s.

While the overall labor market has been red hot, the white-collar job market was much cooler over the past few years. Inflation eroded the wages and salaries of higher-wage workers for much of the post-pandemic period. Now, their real income growth is accelerating rapidly.
 
While higher-wage workers’ real wages fell during the pandemic, rising nonlabor income and a huge wealth effect from rapidly rising stock and home prices more than offset that. Interest, dividend, rental, and proprietors’ incomes all have risen to record highs, totaling $7.1 trillion (saar) in December.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/9353ba9a-191236.png)

Nonlabor income has been a boon, particularly to the retiring Baby Boomers and high-income households, as have rising asset prices. A reduced need to save leaves even more after-tax income to be spent. That’s one reason that the savings rate is down to 3.8% as of December. We expect it to turn negative over the remainder of this decade as retirees continue to spend without the benefit of any labor income.

Slowing immigration is likely to weigh on the growth rates of the labor force and technology-led productivity enhancers may and aggregate weekly hours. So it’s likely that real average hourly earnings growth and the wealth effect will be the main drivers of consumer spending over the next few years.

#### US Economy II: Investment Slowdown? 
While last year was a bright one for business capital spending, it finished with a whimper rather than a bang. For much of 2023 and 2024, government incentives and real business needs sparked a boom in nonresidential fixed investment, particularly in high-tech sectors and construction of manufacturing facilities. The weakness in Q4 was an anomaly in this respect, but we don’t expect it to be the start of a trend.
 
Technological innovation, of course, is a linchpin of our Roaring 2020s scenario, and we expect areas like software and research and development (R&D) to continue growing into a bigger part of the overall economy. The pro-tech, pro-business stance of Trump 2.0 and real demand for AI will continue to drive the high-tech investment boom that now accounts for more than half of US capital spending.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/5900d05f-116046.png)

While the Mangificent-7 tech companies will continue to shell out cash for new AI- and energy-related projects, the rate of growth for that spending may slow this year and next. However, we believe that slowing capex growth by the Mag-7 will be offset by hastening of the S&P 493’s collective investments in technology to augment the productivity of their workforces. Eventually, even small- and medium-sized businesses will be investing in AI-enabled products to increase productivity and efficiency. No doubt, venture capital and private equity firms will implement these technologies across their portfolio companies to boost profit margins.
 
Here’s more on the capital investment front:
 
**(1) Temporary weakness in Q4**
Overall economic growth was strong during Q4. Real final sales, which excludes business inventory investment, rose 3.2% q/q (saar) in Q4. Real private domestic demand—the Fed’s preferred measure of core real GDP, which excludes federal spending, business inventory investment, and trade—also rose 3.2%. However, these were mostly consumer driven. Real business investment rose just 1.5% q/q (saar) in Q4 and 1.7% for the whole year. Though it did reach a record high of $3.5 trillion (saar), annual growth was down from 3.2% in 2023 and 7.8% in 2022.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/6bdd1c44-124093.png)
▌*View Related Live Charts:  [US - Real Private Nonresidential Fixed Investment](https://en.macromicro.me/series/5558/us-real-private-nonresidential-fixed-investment)*

Intellectual property (IP)—which includes software, research and development (R&D), and entertainment, literary, and artistic originals—rose 2.6% q/q (saar) to a new high of $1.5 trillion. However, annual growth was down from 5.8% in 2023 to 4.1% in 2024.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/4fc7e899-164540.png)

Capital equipment investment fell 7.8% q/q (saar), its worst quarter since the pandemic. On a y/y basis, it slowed marginally from 3.5% to 3.4%. However, we expect equipment investment to rebound this quarter as information processing equipment reaches a new record high alongside R&D and software investment.
![file](https://cdn.macromicro.me/blog/new/433f31d4-145053.png)

**(2) Volatile inventories**
Slower private inventories investment reduced real GDP growth by 0.93ppt in Q4 after dragging it down in Q1, largely due to inventory drawdowns by wholesalers and auto dealers. We expect inventory investment to rebound during the first half of this year.

#### US Economy III: Trade Wars & DOGE 
On Saturday, President Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico. Chinese imports were slapped with an additional 10% tariff. These developments are bound to weigh on US economic growth unless trade negotiations between the US and these three trading partners move quickly to reverse the tariffs. Also weighing on the economy might be the Trump administrations moves to cut government spending through executive orders and the efforts of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
 
**(1) Trade wars could weaken global economic growth** 
The US trade deficit impacted Q4’s GDP growth only minimally, but naturally it will be highly topical this year. Trade is not a large portion of US nominal GDP but invariably is interconnected with intermediate prices, labor costs, and the revenues of domestic producers. Given our optimistic outlook for the US consumer—especially relative to Chinese and European consumers—we do not expect tariffs to significantly reduce the trade deficit, which stood at $1.3 trillion (saar) in Q4.

YRI’s real global growth proxy accelerated to 3.8% y/y in Q4. It is simply the sum of real US exports and imports. It is currently growing about as fast as just before Trump 1.0 tariffs turned its growth rate negative in 2019. Trump 2.0 tariffs could turn it negative again.

**(2) Government spending slowdown**
Even if the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) manages to cut federal spending and therefore weigh on real GDP growth, we expect businesses and consumers will fill the gap. Deregulation and lower tax rates are likely to spur more hiring and investment in an economy already at full employment. That should drive increased productivity growth and real wage gains.
